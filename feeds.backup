I have written on the subject before, but its renewed focus demands a new column.</p> <p>First, a little history and context. Tax law has many provisions for nonprofit organizations, including 29 under Section 501(c) in the Internal Revenue Code. Federal credit unions, for example, are under 501(c)(1), business trade associations are under 501(c)(6), mutual insurance companies are under 501(c)(15), black-lung benefit trusts are under 501(c)(21), and so on. Most of what we think of as nonprofits—religious, educational, scientific, and charitable organizations—are under Section 501(c)(3).</p> <p>Section 501(c)(4) applies to “social-welfare organizations,” nonprofits that promote social welfare through public-education campaigns, including some lobbying. What about nonprofits that aim to influence elections and engage in campaigning as their primary activity? Those entities organize under Section 527 of the code. That includes political parties, PACs, and other related groups. The law clearly and unequivocally defines 501(c)(4)s as <em>exclusively</em> social-welfare organizations. Not “sort of” social-welfare organizations, not “kind of” social-welfare organizations, not even “primarily” social-welfare organizations. But for decades, in direct defiance of the clear language of the law, the IRS has used regulations that define 501(c)(4)s as <em>primarily</em> social-welfare organizations. Why did the IRS do this? Tax experts in this area tell me that this is a convention used at times by the agency to give it a tiny bit of flexibility to avoid rigid characterizations and applications of the law—meaning that if an organization accidentally or unknowingly used an insubstantial portion of its resources in ways that were not within the rubric of social-welfare organizations, the agents or auditors would not be forced to throw the book at it.</p> <!-- START \"MORE ON\" SINGLE STORY BOX v. 2 --> <!-- END \"MORE ON\" SINGLE STORY BOX v. 2 --><p>Groups classified as 501(c)(4)s do not have to disclose the identity of their donors. Before 2000, 527s did not have to disclose their donors either—outside organizations used 527s to run ads clearly designed to elect or defeat candidates, but they were called “issue ads” because they did not explicitly say “elect” or “defeat” Candidate X or Y. These outside groups gravitated to 527s to escape disclosure and run their campaigns in secret—and to avoid contribution limits. But after 2000, the new way to avoid disclosure became the 501(c)(4)s. Following the <em>Citizens United</em> decision in 2010—which opened the door to corporations, including nonprofit groups, to make direct expenditures in federal elections—enterprising and aggressive lawyers pushed the envelope. They used the IRS’s application of “primarily” in its regulatory approach to social-welfare organizations to mean 50.01 percent of the organizations’ activities, and encouraged the newly formed groups to spend a fortune on political ads during a campaign, and then afterward run so-called “issue ads”—many of which were in fact disguised campaign ads—to meet their 50.01 percent standard.</p> <p>For a group intent on influencing the outcome of elections, there was only one reason to create a 501(c)(4) instead of turning to a 527 or simply forming an independent super PAC—<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2013/12/theres-no-way-to-follow-the-money/282394/\">secrecy</a>. For many groups, that was explicit: When Karl Rove and his colleagues formed Crossroads GPS to operate alongside his super PAC, American Crossroads, the communications to potential donors made it clear that if they wanted to remain anonymous, the GPS route would enable them to do so.</p> <p>For a federal revenue service that is understaffed and deeply sensitive about getting in the middle of a political dispute, the easiest way out was the passive one: Accept the standard that flew directly in the face of the law but was insisted upon by aggressive political consultants and their consiglieri to inject huge amounts of dark money into federal races. When the IRS publicly announced that it would consider applying gift taxes to donors to these groups that went over the line, the organized and concerted campaign of intimidation by the pols forced the agency to back off.</p> <p>After <em>Citizens United</em> and another related appeals-court decision, <em>SpeechNow</em>, we saw an explosion of super PACs and of outside money flooding into campaigns, and an explosion in groups trying to get 501(c)(4) status. Many clearly did not deserve it—if you are a “Tea Party” group, with a direct goal of influencing elections, you clearly belong as a 527. The same is true of many organizations aimed at influencing elections with the word “party” in the name, or even of others using words like “progressive” or “occupy.” Faced with a flood of applications, and recognizing, thanks in part to efforts by reform groups and lawmakers, that their handy interpretation of “primarily” in the regs had exploded into a gaping loophole, the IRS began its ham-handed and overreaching efforts to screen groups.</p> <p>Now, appropriately and commendably, the IRS is trying to write new and clear regulations that meet the test of complying with the explicit language of the law, as the Supreme Court itself, in decisions like <em>Better Business Bureau v. the United States</em>, has said means exactly what it says: Exclusively means exclusively. A very modest amount of political activity can fit under the rubric of social-welfare organizations, and the IRS is trying to make it easy for organizations by defining both what those political activities are and what proportion of the organization’s budget can be applied.</p> <p>Not surprisingly, opponents are going to DEFCON 1—for one reason, and one reason only: They want to keep secret the hundreds of millions in dark, undisclosed money to run attack ads and muddy the waters. This attack on the IRS, by lawmakers like Mitch McConnell, Issa, and Dave Camp, and by their outside political hacks and counselors, is all about muzzling the IRS to maintain secrecy and avoid the disclosure that the Supreme Court wholeheartedly and almost unanimously endorsed in decisions including <em>Citizens United</em>.</p><img width='1' height='1'

One of them <a href=\"http://www.kake.com/home/headlines/2-hurt-in-accidental-shooting-at-south-Wichita-bar-245690191.html\">explained to police</a> that he had a concealed-carry handgun license, and that he’d been drinking at the Shot Time II bar when he’d accidentally fired a bullet through his own leg and into the leg of the man sitting next to him.</p> <p>Kansas law used to prohibit CCH license holders from bringing their guns into bars, but then in 2007 the state legislature <a href=\"http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2008/jun/08/bar_owners_surprised_change_concealed_carry_law/\">quietly changed the rules</a>, <span>resulting in confusion for both patrons and proprietors</span>. Now, unless the bar <a href=\"https://ag.ks.gov/docs/documents/concealed-carry-statutes.pdf\">conspicuously posts</a> a “no guns” sign, licensed carriers may bring their concealed weapons inside. A longstanding Sedgwick County law <a href=\"http://library.municode.com/HTML/19944/level4/SECOKACO_CH4ALBE_ARTIIRECEMABEES_DIV1GE.html#SECOKACO_CH4ALBE_ARTIIRECEMABEES_DIV1GE_S4-36POWE\">bans</a> guns, concealed or not, from all bars, but that ordinance no longer means anything; the state has stripped municipalities of their authority to regulate most aspects of gun ownership and use. This type of legislation is called preemption, and it influences nearly every community’s relationship with guns—not just in Kansas but throughout the U.S.</p> <p>Such laws reflect a divide not only between those who favor expanded gun rights and those who oppose them, but also a geographical divide between policymakers. Metropolitan communities (<a href=\"http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/tables/18tabledatadecpdf\">where most gun crimes occur</a>) tend to have a <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/02/27/guns-ingrained-in-rural-existence/1949479/\">different perspective</a> about gun rights and gun violence than their more rural surrounds. Laura Cutilletta, senior staff attorney at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said the specific crime problems in communities often lead to locally tailored solutions—which can’t be implemented if they’ve been preempted by state law.</p> <p>“It used to be that local governments all across the country could regulate what was best for their community when it came to firearms,” Cutilletta explained. “And then the NRA went on this campaign to convince states, one by one, to restrict that authority. And they were very successful. Over the years—a couple of decades—almost every state has preempted local regulation of firearms. What the states are doing now is introducing laws that make preemption more broad.”</p> <p>When Illinois passed a <a href=\"http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/publicacts/98/PDF/098-0063.pdf\">law</a> last year that created a concealed-handgun permitting process, the legislation included a preemption clause to prohibit cities like Chicago from passing their own ordinances restricting concealed carry. Now, Sheriff Tom Dart of Cook County (which includes the Windy City) is concerned that <a href=\"http://www.suntimes.com/opinions/25507823-474/vetting-of-concealed-carry-applicants-too-weak-to-trust.html\">hundreds of people with criminal records have been cleared for concealed carry by the state</a>, and there’s little he can do to stop ex-convicts from legally carrying concealed weapons in his jurisdiction. Dart even found that 12 of Illinois’s certified concealed-carry instructors have criminal backgrounds.</p> <p>Cook County isn’t the only urban community hamstrung by preemption. In an effort to reduce one of the highest homicide rates in the U.S., community leaders in St. Louis have pursued countless crime-reduction initiatives—youth outreach, employment programs, and mental-health services—everything but gun reform, which is beyond their purview. Through a series of preemption measures beginning in 1984, the Missouri legislature has <a href=\"http://www.moga.mo.gov/statutes/c000-099/0210000750.htm\">systematically stripped city and county governments</a> of the authority to regulate guns.</p> <p>Last month, the Missouri senate approved a <a href=\"http://www.senate.mo.gov/14info/BTS_Web/Bill.aspx?SessionType=R&BillID=27723646\">bill</a> that would remove the last bit of local authority to regulate firearms—a municipality’s prerogative to decide where and how gun owners can openly carry their weapons in public. The bill would also lower the minimum age to get a concealed-carry permit from 21 to 19, allow designated teachers or administrators to carry guns in schools, and nullify federal gun laws. Anyone attempting to enforce a federal gun law that has been “declared invalid” by Missouri could be jailed for up to one year. When the bill moved through committee, the only dissenting vote came from Senator Jamilah Nasheed, who represents St. Louis.</p> <p>If SB 613 becomes law, Missouri would join a <a href=\"http://firearmsfreedomact.com/\">growing list</a> of states that have passed nullification legislation, none of which is likely to survive scrutiny in the courts. Most of these bills are modeled on a 2009 Montana law, which was <a href=\"http://missoulian.com/news/local/th-circuit-rules-against-montana-law-bucking-federal-gun-rules/article_b8432896-0c3b-11e3-8536-0019bb2963f4.html\">invalidated</a> last year by the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.</p> <p>“The bill is unconstitutional,” said Rebecca Morgan of the Missouri chapter of <a href=\"http://momsdemandaction.org\">Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America</a>. “But even if it’s found to be unconstitutional, Missouri is a state where every bill is severable. That means that, even if a court finds part of it unconstitutional, the rest remains. And there are so many things in this bill that we find reckless.”</p> <p>Former Ohio Governor Bob Taft saw firsthand how the debate about gun policy pits rural communities against bigger cities. “There’s very strong support for gun rights in Ohio. Unfortunately, there’s also a certain amount of crime, particularly in the large urban centers,” Taft said. “We have over 900 municipalities in Ohio, and often conditions and circumstances differ from one to another, so there’s a rationale for local governments to craft their own legislation. So that’s an argument for providing some flexibility to the local governments with regards to gun laws.”</p> <p>Taft vetoed Ohio’s 2006 preemption bill, but senate leaders in his own Republican Party overrode the veto—the first time an Ohio governor’s veto had been overridden in nearly three decades. Then, when Cleveland sued the state in an (ultimately unsuccessful) effort to evade preemption, the National Rifle Association <a href=\"http://www.nraila.org/news-issues/news-from-nra-ila/2007/nra-joins-lawsuit-to-protect-ohio-fir.aspx\">stepped in</a>, joining the suit as defendant-intervener. The gun lobby warned of dire consequences if Cleveland won the lawsuit and regained the authority it had enjoyed for more than a century: “Gun owners living in Ohio … could lose their ability to legally protect themselves and their families.”</p> <p>The NRA frames its <a href=\"http://www.nraila.org/news-issues/fact-sheets/2006/firearms-preemption-laws.aspx\">support of preemption</a> as an effort to simplify “a complex patchwork of restrictions that change from one local jurisdiction to the next.” There are just too many different ordinances, they say, which could be confusing or inconvenient to gun owners.</p> <p>“I can travel 30 minutes from my home and travel through four jurisdictions,” explained Kansas State Rifle Association President Patricia Stoneking, who testified in support of a <a href=\"http://www.kslegislature.org/li/b2013_14/measures/documents/hb2473_00_0000.pdf\">new preemption bill</a> that would eliminate what little local authority remained after Kansas passed a preemption law in 2007. “How am I to know what the law of all those jurisdictions say? What their individual ordinances are? Uniformity in all firearms laws is the most prudent action to take.”</p> <p>But does that ideal—uniformity in all firearms laws—apply across state borders? Should all U.S. states conform to one set of federal firearms laws?</p> <p>Of course not. “The federal government has no authority to regulate firearms—period,” Stoneking said.</p> <p>Perhaps the preemption debate isn’t about resolving jurisdictional disputes or sorting out the finer points of federalism after all—it’s mostly about expanding gun rights and removing as many restrictions as possible. “There are lots of areas where home rule certainly applies,” Stoneking said. “But this is not one of them. Not when it comes to an unalienable, natural, God-given right for people to protect themselves.”  </p><img width='1' height='1' src='http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/37dbe48c/sc/40/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fdisarmed-how-cities-are-losing-the-power-to-regulate-guns%2F284220%2F&t=Disarmed%3A+How+Cities+Are+Losing+the+Power+to+Regulate+Guns\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png\" border=\"0\" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fdisarmed-how-cities-are-losing-the-power-to-regulate-guns%2F284220%2F&t=Disarmed%3A+How+Cities+Are+Losing+the+Power+to+Regulate+Guns\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png\" border=\"0\" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fdisarmed-how-cities-are-losing-the-power-to-regulate-guns%2F284220%2F&t=Disarmed%3A+How+Cities+Are+Losing+the+Power+to+Regulate+Guns\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png\" border=\"0\" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fdisarmed-how-cities-are-losing-the-power-to-regulate-guns%2F284220%2F&t=Disarmed%3A+How+Cities+Are+Losing+the+Power+to+Regulate+Guns\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png\" border=\"0\" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fdisarmed-how-cities-are-losing-the-power-to-regulate-guns%2F284220%2F&t=Disarmed%3A+How+Cities+Are+Losing+the+Power+to+Regulate+Guns\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png\" border=\"0\" /></a></td><td valign='middle'></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531386811/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dbe48c/sc/40/rc/1/rc.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531386811/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dbe48c/sc/40/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531386811/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dbe48c/sc/40/rc/2/rc.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531386811/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dbe48c/sc/40/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531386811/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dbe48c/sc/40/rc/3/rc.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531386811/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dbe48c/sc/40/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531386811/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dbe48c/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531386811/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dbe48c/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186531386811/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dbe48c/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/dAMVhdoAwKU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", "permalinkUrl" : "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/dAMVhdoAwKU/story01.htm", "standardLinks" : { "alternate" : [ { "title" : "Disarmed: How Cities Are Losing the Power to Regulate Guns", "rel" : "alternate", "href" : "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/dAMVhdoAwKU/story01.htm", "type" : "text/html" } ], "thumbnail" : [ { "title" : "Disarmed: How Cities Are Losing the Power to Regulate Guns", "rel" : "thumbnail", "href" : "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/newsroom/img/mt/2014/03/RTR39ULV/thumb.jpg?n1zkdx", "type" : "image/jpeg" } ], "canonical" : [ { "title" : "Disarmed: How Cities Are Losing the Power to Regulate Guns", "rel" : "canonical", "href" : "http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/37dbe48c/sc/40/l/0L0Stheatlantic0N0Cpolitics0Carchive0C20A140C0A30Cdisarmed0Ehow0Ecities0Eare0Elosing0Ethe0Epower0Eto0Eregulate0Eguns0C284220A0C/story01.htm", "type" : "text/html" } ] }, "actor" : { "displayName" : "Matt Valentine", "id" : "Matt Valentine" }, "categories" : [ "Politics" ], "source" : { "id" : "master-feed-the-atlantic-2014-3-6-12", "title" : "Master Feed : The Atlantic", "updated" : 1394107728, "permalinkUrl" : "http://www.theatlantic.com/", "standardLinks" : { "alternate" : [ { "title" : "Master Feed : The Atlantic", "rel" : "alternate", "href" : "http://www.theatlantic.com/", "type" : "text/html" } ], "self" : [ { "title" : "Master Feed : The Atlantic", "rel" : "self", "href" : "http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheAtlantic", "type" : "application/rss+xml" } ], "hub" : [ { "title" : "", "rel" : "hub", "href" : "http://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/", "type" : "text/html" } ] } }, "_id" : { "$oid" : "53186dff6662b5901c822b30" } }

If the makers of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1856010/\"><em>House of Cards</em></a> are looking to expand the franchise south, they should get to know Venezuela’s Frank Underwood.</p> <p>In recent weeks, Venezuela’s political crisis—mass protests in response to a flailing economy, rampant scarcities, soaring crime, and ideological polarization—has been <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-03/venezuelan-opposition-vows-to-maintain-pressure-on-government.html\">portrayed</a> in international media primarily as a struggle between a monolithic government and the embattled remnants of the nation’s traditional middle class. But this narrative is superficial; several storylines, both personal and social, are playing out below the surface. And these include a bitter clash between Hugo Chávez’s successor and almost-successor for the soul of his party and the future of the country.</p> <p>For one party in this clash, President Nicolás Maduro, Venezuela’s unrest has been deeply damaging. He is under fire for his ready reliance on state violence in dealing with unarmed demonstrators, which has left 18 people dead. In public appearances, he seems increasingly exhausted and more than a little unhinged.</p> <p>For the other party, Cabello, the turmoil has been galvanizing. Suddenly he’s everywhere. When the popular opposition figure Leopoldo López was declared a wanted man, it was Cabello who negotiated his surrender with his family. Later, during the arrest itself—a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-26238612\">preposterous affair</a> in which López gave himself up during a mass demonstration—it was again Cabello who showed up to escort him to jail (despite having no judicial or police authority), ostensibly to “<a href=\"http://noticiaaldia.com/2014/02/arreaza-cabello-garantizo-la-seguridad-de-leopoldo-lopez/\">assure his safety</a>.” Soon after, when security forces squared off with Ángel Vivas, a renegade former general who barricaded himself in his home in defiance of an arrest order, it was Cabello—not Maduro—who played the <a href=\"http://diariocorreo.pe/ultimas/noticias/8662403/edicion+lima/diosdado-cabello-muestra-las-armas-del-gen\">most visible official role</a> in the dramatic showdown.</p> <p>What’s more, mere days after López first called for anti-government protests, state media announced that Cabello would be starring in his own weekly television show. The first episode featured a ‘surprise’ visit from Maduro and a music video by Cabello’s daughter, Daniella, in which she sang a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Pnq-E2ZEnQ\">ballad</a> to the recently departed Chávez. The video went viral among government supporters, and Daniella has remained in the headlines by publicly “<a href=\"http://www.gentedehoy.com/noticias/2014/02/hija-de-diosdado-cabello-acepta-disculpas-le-estrecha-la-mano-joven-la-amenazo-de-muerte/\">forgiving</a>” a young regime opponent who had sent her a threatening tweet.</p> <p>In other words, as Venezuela marks the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-26446063\">first anniversary</a> since Chávez’s death, the struggle between Cabello and Maduro is becoming more pronounced. And Cabello appears to be winning.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>***</strong></p> <p>Diosdado Cabello began his political career as one of Chávez’s junior comrades-in-arms from the military, during a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/05/world/venezuela-crushes-army-coup-attempt.html\">failed putsch</a> against the government of Carlos Andrés Pérez in 1992. The plot miscarried, and Cabello was briefly jailed for his participation. After his release, he assisted Chávez during his first successful presidential bid in 1998, and was singled out early on for his toughness and efficacy.</p> <figure><img alt=\"\" height=\"395\" src=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/newsroom/img/posts/2014/03/RTX5A5G/e1286948f.jpg\" width=\"570\"/><figcaption class=\"caption\">Diosdado Cabello walks with Hugo Chávez in 2008. (Reuters/Miraflores Palace)</figcaption></figure><p>His political trajectory since has been remarkable both for its duration (Chávez was quick to sideline potential rivals) and its variety. His posts have included stints as the minister of planning, justice, the interior, public works, and housing, along with stretches as a state governor, the head of the National Telecommunications Commission, and Chávez’s chief of staff and presidential campaign manager. Following the collapse of a bloodless coup in 2002 that briefly ousted Chávez, Cabello, then vice president, even assumed the presidency—an ephemeral tenure that lasted mere hours until Chávez himself could be located and constitutional order (or at least what passes for it in Venezuela) restored. Ten years later, with Chávez ailing, many <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7af5f31c-9ea8-11e1-a767-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2uyHAvRzs\">suspected</a> Cabello might be anointed his heir, but he was instead passed over for the country’s current president, Nicolás Maduro.</p> <p>Today, as head of Venezuela’s Socialist-dominated unicameral legislature, the 50-year-old Cabello rules over his fief with brutal efficiency. For all the incarnadine gusto of Kevin Spacey’s character, Cabello often does Frank Underwood one better. On his watch, the National Assembly has made a habit of ignoring constitutional hurdles entirely—at various times preventing opposition members from speaking in session, suspending their salaries, stripping particularly problematic legislators of parliamentary immunity, and, on one occasion, even presiding over the <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/05/01/fisticuffs-in-parliament.html\">physical beating</a> of unfriendly lawmakers while the assembly was meeting.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p> <p>In a region of the world where charisma is king, Cabello—whose first name, Diosdado, translates to “God-given”—is something of an oddity. He amasses his influence not as a mesmerizer of crowds, but as a master manipulator of those around him. Artfully leveraging his position and alliances, he mercilessly crushes enemies, lavishly rewards friends, and even helps fill government offices with members of his own family. His wife is a member of the National Assembly, his brother is in charge of the nation’s taxation authority, and his sister is a Venezuelan legate to the United Nations.</p> <p>In these ways, Cabello has accumulated clout among crucial constituencies such as wealthy businessmen and the armed forces, where <a href=\"http://www.ultimasnoticias.com.ve/noticias/actualidad/politica/generacion-diosdado-llego-a-rango-de-general.aspx\">36 generals</a> are from Cabello’s graduating class at Venezuela’s military academy. Cabello’s tendrils are even rumored to extend to shadier realms, including alleged ties to <a href=\"http://caracaschronicles.com/2013/05/24/the-cuban-elephant-in-the-room/\">narco-trafficking</a> <a href=\"http://www.eluniversal.com/nacional-y-politica/120418/former-justice-links-venezuelan-officials-to-drug-trafficking\">syndicates</a> and criminal organizations. A Wikileaked <a href=\"http://www.wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09CARACAS918_a.html\">U.S. Embassy cable</a> from 2009 characterized Cabello as a “major pole” of corruption within the regime, describing him as “amassing great power and control over the regime’s apparatus as well as a private fortune, often through intimidation behind the scenes.” The communiqué likewise entertained speculation that “Chavez himself might be concerned about Cabello's growing influence but unable to diminish it.”</p> <p>This strategy is not without its drawbacks. Cabello is personally despised by regime opponents, who see him as a bullying mafioso, and also deeply distrusted by many of the government’s own supporters, who view him as corrupt, opportunistic, overly ambitious, and not sufficiently dedicated to the revolutionary principles of the United Socialist Party.</p> <p>And true to Frank Underwood form, Cabello is excellent at getting himself appointed to lofty posts but less skilled at the ballot box. In 2008—despite enjoying the government’s vast financial and logistical support, and the tacit assistance of Venezuela’s famously preferential electoral authorities—he lost his reelection bid for the governorship of Miranda, Venezuela’s second-most-populous state, to Henrique Capriles: a foil who would eventually rise to challenge Chávez himself for the presidency in 2012. </p> <figure><img alt=\"\" height=\"380\" src=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/newsroom/img/posts/2014/03/RTR3EOA8/31ea4dbf9.jpg\" width=\"570\"/><figcaption class=\"caption\">Nicolás Maduro and Diosdado Cabello beside Hugo Chávez's coffin. (Reuters/Miraflores Palace)</figcaption></figure><p>Cabello’s influence is shaped by the <a href=\"http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/01/23/The_Political_Afterlife_of_Hugo_Chavez\">two divergent</a> political groups within Venezuela’s ruling party: one pragmatic, the other ideological. The first, typified by Cabello, is the more classically populist Latin American movement: nationalistic, corrupt, and platitudinous. The second seeks international revolution and a wholesale transformation of Latin American society. Through oil diplomacy, this latter camp has sought to turn socialist Venezuela into a force in regional and global affairs, pumping state funds into maintaining friendly client regimes in Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador, and Nicaragua. Its members have allegedly also worked to influence elections as far afield as <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/wikileaks-mexico-asked-us-to-counter-chavez/\">Mexico</a> while strengthening ties with countries such as Iran and Russia.</p> <p>At the peak of his power, Chávez was able to harness both these factions through the sheer force of his personality. Prior to his death, however, he staked his legacy on the ideological camp. As his health failed, Cuban influence within the Venezuelan government grew, and the regime in Havana—highly dependent economically on Venezuelan largesse in the form of subsidized oil and other assistance—pushed hard for Maduro, an idealist with strong ties to the Castros, to be made successor. Chávez’s cancer diagnosis likewise came at a time when Cabello’s clout <a href=\"http://www.noticias24.com/actualidad/noticia/267074/aunque-parezca-que-la-estrella-de-diosdado-cabello-ha-venido-declinando-sigue-teniendo-mucho-poder/\">seemed</a> to be waning. Old corruption allegations <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xicf0l_entre-las-denuncias-por-corrupcion-contra-diosdado-cabello_news\">resurfaced</a>, and some of his <a href=\"http://www.avn.info.ve/contenido/ch%C3%A1vez-propone-diosdado-cabello-como-gobernador-monagas\">allies were purged</a>. This estrangement appeared to peak in 2012 when Chávez, during a live televised broadcast, <a href=\"http://www.avn.info.ve/contenido/ch%C3%A1vez-propone-diosdado-cabello-como-gobernador-monagas\">unexpectedly recommended </a>that Cabello run for the governorship of remote Monagas state. The region may have been Cabello's birthplace, but the proposal smacked of political exile. Cabello demurred.</p> <p>Following Chávez’s death, and Maduro’s enshrinement as his heir, the Venezuelan constitution <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2013/03/06/venezuelan_constitution_vp_nicolas_maduro_named_interim_leader_in_conflict.html\">arguably</a> left Cabello, as head of the legislature, acting president until elections could be held. Yet Maduro’s cadre managed to convince the relevant authorities to simply ignore the provision, allowing the position to pass to him and depriving Cabello of another shot at a truncated presidency.</p> <p>While the two men have been publicly supportive of each other since then, the relationship may be far tenser than they let on. In April 2013, after Maduro eked out a contested electoral victory over Capriles, Cabello <a href=\"http://caracaschronicles.com/2013/04/15/the-tweets-are-god-given/\">tweeted</a> to his nearly 1 million followers that the government should engage in “<a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e9fe1552-a5d5-11e2-b7dc-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2v7xeAAVj\">profound self reflection</a>” about why it had performed so poorly relative to Chávez’s last election. As the latter race had taken place mere months before, against the same opponent and with the same regime advantages, the implication of Cabello’s message was clear: ‘Maduro is a liability.’</p> <p>A number of leaks <a href=\"http://caracaschronicles.com/2013/05/20/a-house-divided/\">have offered</a> further evidence of an enduring rivalry. In May 2013, the opposition mysteriously obtained a recording of Mario Silva, a popular, pro-government ideologue and television host, discussing internal regime matters with a high-ranking member of Cuba’s secret police. In the audio, Cabello, whom Silva described as a “very great son of a whore,” was depicted as a power-hungry, kleptomaniacal thug, and a constant but irremovable thorn in the side of Maduro.</p> <p>Publicly, the government tried to discredit the recordings as CIA/Mossad counterfeits, but Silva was promptly <a href=\"http://www.eluniversal.com/nacional-y-politica/130521/mario-silva-off-the-air-for-health-reasons\">taken off the air</a>. Cabello emerged from the scandal relatively unscathed and soon appeared beside Maduro on state television, looking untouchable and leaving some Venezuelans to <a href=\"http://caracaschronicles.com/2013/05/21/reading-the-god-given-tea-leaves/\">wonder</a> if he had orchestrated the leak himself.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p> <p>As Venezuela’s protests enter their fourth week, the ultimate goal of Cabello’s latest charm offensive remains unclear. Opposition leaders have <a href=\"http://www.eluniversal.com/nacional-y-politica/140220/hay-a-quienes-les-interesa-el-maduro-vete-ya-porque-es-diosdado-vente-\">expressed concerns</a> that, in facing off against Maduro, they risk enabling a <a href=\"http://www.mdzol.com/nota/517724/\">Cabello takeover.</a> Yet even in the unlikely event that the crisis results in Maduro resigning or being pushed out, a Cabello presidency would still require a national election, barring the outright suspension of the country’s constitution. And elections have never been Cabello’s forte.</p><p> But it’s best to not give such inconveniences much thought. Unlike Frank Underwood, his <em>Netflixolano</em> counterpart, Cabello’s endgame may not be the presidency itself. It is, instead, power with impunity that he seeks. If Maduro falls, it is difficult to imagine a scenario in which Cabello does not play an integral role in deciding who and what succeeds him. With the deck sufficiently stacked, it may not matter much to Diosdado Cabello who the king is—so long as he remains the ace.</p><img width='1' height='1' src='http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/37dba640/sc/42/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Finternational%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fthe-frank-underwood-of-venezuela%2F284259%2F&t=The+Frank+Underwood+of+Venezuela\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png\" border=\"0\" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Finternational%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fthe-frank-underwood-of-venezuela%2F284259%2F&t=The+Frank+Underwood+of+Venezuela\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png\" border=\"0\" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Finternational%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fthe-frank-underwood-of-venezuela%2F284259%2F&t=The+Frank+Underwood+of+Venezuela\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png\" border=\"0\" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Finternational%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fthe-frank-underwood-of-venezuela%2F284259%2F&t=The+Frank+Underwood+of+Venezuela\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png\" border=\"0\" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Finternational%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fthe-frank-underwood-of-venezuela%2F284259%2F&t=The+Frank+Underwood+of+Venezuela\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png\" border=\"0\" /></a></td><td valign='middle'></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531451860/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dba640/sc/42/rc/1/rc.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531451860/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dba640/sc/42/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531451860/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dba640/sc/42/rc/2/rc.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531451860/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dba640/sc/42/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531451860/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dba640/sc/42/rc/3/rc.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531451860/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dba640/sc/42/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531451860/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dba640/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531451860/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dba640/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186531451860/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dba640/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/ydCrHOBwdCc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", "permalinkUrl" : "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/ydCrHOBwdCc/story01.htm", "standardLinks" : { "alternate" : [ { "title" : "The Frank Underwood of Venezuela", "rel" : "alternate", "href" : "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/ydCrHOBwdCc/story01.htm", "type" : "text/html" } ], "thumbnail" : [ { "title" : "The Frank Underwood of Venezuela", "rel" : "thumbnail", "href" : "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/newsroom/img/mt/2014/03/Diosdado/thumb.jpg?n20loh", "type" : "image/jpeg" } ], "canonical" : [ { "title" : "The Frank Underwood of Venezuela", "rel" : "canonical", "href" : "http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/37dba640/sc/42/l/0L0Stheatlantic0N0Cinternational0Carchive0C20A140C0A30Cthe0Efrank0Eunderwood0Eof0Evenezuela0C2842590C/story01.htm", "type" : "text/html" } ] }, "actor" : { "displayName" : "Daniel Lansberg-Rodriguez", "id" : "Daniel Lansberg-Rodriguez" }, "categories" : [ "International" ], "_id" : { "$oid" : "531874ce6662b5901c822b37" } }

This past awards season saw splashy spectacles (<em>The Great Gatsby</em>), gutsy biopics (<em>Diana</em>), and seemingly slam-dunk awards bait (<em>The Butler</em>) blow into theaters with the torrent winds of great Oscar expectations and blow out with the faint gusts of disappointment. And then there were those that early on seemed like worthy nominees—<em>Fruitvale Station</em>, <em>Inside Llewyn Davis</em>—before being eclipsed by late, unexpected contenders.</p> <p><!-- START \"MORE ON\" SINGLE STORY BOX v. 2 --></p> <!-- END \"MORE ON\" SINGLE STORY BOX v. 2 --><p>All of which is to say, predicting Oscar nominees is hard. But it’s also fun. Even if the movies and actors that appear to be likely champions now turn out to be busts come next Awards season, looking ahead at the prestigious release schedule at least gives us a chance to get excited about the coming year filmgoing.</p> <p>Twelve months before the 2013 Academy Awards, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/02/oscars-2013-our-very-very-early-predictions-for-next-years-contenders/253733/#slide1\">I called seven of the eventual nine Best Picture nominees</a>, including the winner, <em>Argo</em>. A year before last Sunday’s ceremony, I correctly predicted… <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/03/the-oscars-in-2014-very-very-early-predictions-for-next-years-awards/273624/\">two of nine</a>, <em>Wolf of Wall Street</em> and <em>Dallas Buyers’ Club</em> (though I also gave honorable mentions to two other eventual nominees, <em>Captain Phillips</em> and <em>12 Years a Slave</em>). Here's a try at prophesying 2015. Gauging by buzz and on-paper credentials, which films seem to be the best bets for Academy Awards nominations next year? Below, the very, <em>very</em> early predictions.</p> <hr/><p><big><strong><em>The Grand Budapest Hotel</em></strong></big><br/> Release Date: March 7</p> <p>Wes Anderson’s unique brand of quirk and anarchy once drew mostly a cult following while the mainstream and bigger awards organizations looked on with bemusement. But the back-to-back pairing of <em>Fantastic Mr. Fox</em> and <em>Moonrise Kingdom </em>has rapidly bumped Anderson up from indie-darling status to bona fide Oscar player, with <em>Moonrise</em> considered a serious contender for a Best Picture nomination last year. <em>The Grand Budapest Hotel</em> already looks likely to eclipse <em>Moonrise</em>’s popularity with critics and awards groups, thanks to rapturous early reviews. At this premature juncture, consider the film a likely Best Picture contender, the delightful Ralph Fiennes a possible Best Actor nominee, and the script a solid bet for Best Original Screenplay.</p> <iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"321\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/1Fg5iWmQjwk\" width=\"570\"></iframe> <p><big><strong><em>Jersey Boys</em></strong></big><br/> Release Date: June 20</p> <p>The past decade or so has shown that film adaptations of modern musicals have the potential to be epic (<em>Les Miserables</em>) and great fun (<em>Hairspray</em>) … or bloated and bad (<em>Nine</em>). There’s reason, though, to be optimistic about the upcoming adaptation of the Tony-winner <em>Jersey Boys</em>. The biggest reason, of course, is that Clint Eastwood is directing. The production also features Oscar-bait-by-numbers plot that peeks into the tumultuous and corrupt real-life story of one of the industry’s most beloved artists, the Four Seasons. It was wise of Eastwood to cast John Lloyd Young, who won a Tony for originating the Frankie Valli role on Broadway, and even wiser to cast Christopher Walken—a Best Supporting Actor contender if there ever was one.</p> <p><big><strong><em>Gone Girl</em></strong></big><br/> Release Date: October 3</p> <p>It’s got the hype. It’s got the fall release. And it’s got David Fincher at the helm. <em>Gone Girl</em> was the scorching summer beach read of 2012, and now it’s one of the most anticipated movies of 2015. If Fincher executes well on the book’s soapy thriller elements, <em>Gone Girl</em> could be a <em>Social Network</em>-like success: a sharp and swift adult drama that pulls in both box-office dollars and awards attention. Big scrutiny will be on Ben Affleck, whose casting in the lead role was controversial, to say the least. But it’s Rosamund Pike who stands the best bet of scoring on Oscar night, though her complex role may be near-impossible to pull off sympathetically.</p> <p><big><strong><em>Interstellar</em></strong></big><br/> Release Date: November 7</p> <p><em>Interstellar</em> is a Christopher Nolan film, which, due to the <em>Dark Knight</em> director’s secretive style, means we know very little about it. But the facts as they stand are these: It’s a futuristic sci-fi drama, it’s likely to be a technical and visual marvel, and it features a <em>stacked</em> cast, including Anne Hathaway, Matthew McConaughey, Jessica Chastain, Matt Damon, Ellen Burstyn, and Michael Caine. As skilled as he is at mining introspection, humanity, and nuance from men dressed as bats, Nolan has a just-as-strong record when he applies his point of view to original scripts. (See: the Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay nods for <em>Inception</em>.) A stirring, mysterious trailer already released hints that <em>Interstellar</em> brims with that same potential.</p> <iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"321\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/3WzHXI5HizQ\" width=\"570\"></iframe> <p><big><strong><em>Into the Woods</em></strong></big><br/> Release Date: December 25</p> <p>The first time Rob Marshall shepherded a beloved musical to the big screen, the spectacular result was the Best Picture-winning <em>Chicago</em>. The second time, the result was the laborious bomb, <em>Nine</em>. Expectations, then, range from unbridled excitement to paralyzing fear for his upcoming adaptation of <em>Into the Woods</em>. There are reasons to have faith, though. Unlike <em>Nine</em> and its meandering and often forgettable score, <em>Into the Woods</em> features some of Stephen Sondheim’s best and most iconic music. Then there’s the cast, including Anna Kendrick as Cinderella, Emily Blunt as The Baker’s Wife, and James Corden as The Baker. Throw in the curious but potentially brilliant choice of Johnny Depp as The Wolf and the lazy but potentially brilliant choice of Meryl Streep as The Witch, and you have the makings of an Oscar happily ever after.</p> <p><big><strong><em>Unbroken</em></strong></big><br/> Release Date: December 25</p> <p>The buzz on <em>Unbroken</em> is already deafening, and surprisingly, the words “Angelina Jolie” only play a small role in generating it. Jolie is directing the flick, the real-life story of Italian-American Olympian Louis Zamperini, who became a prisoner of war during World War II. The script is based on the acclaimed book by Laura Hillenbrand. Oh yeah, and it was written by the Coen Brothers. Combine the Coens' record of brilliance with the surprisingly refined directing chops Jolie showed off with 2011’s <em>In the Land of Blood and Honey</em>, and <em>Unbroken</em> could be a major contender in multiple categories.</p> <p><em><big><strong>Big Eyes</strong></big></em><br/> Release Date: TBD</p> <p><em>Big Eyes</em> is a biopic of artist Margaret Keane, whose creepy-beautiful paintings of children with disproportionately large eyes are probably hanging in your aunt’s bathroom. The plot centers on her legal battle with her husband, Walter, who later claimed credit for her work. Tim Burton will direct, the first time he’s helmed a biopic since 1994’s <em>Ed Wood</em>. Two-time Oscar winner Christoph Waltz will play Walter while Amy Adams, fresh off her fifth Oscar nomination in eight years and her career-best performance in <em>American Hustle</em>, will play Margaret. In other words: \"awards-bait\" is scribbled all over this.</p> <p><big><strong><em>Boyhood</em></strong></big><br/> Release Date: TBD</p> <p><em>Boyhood</em> could be the slow-burning indie Oscar surprise of the coming year. The meta-narrative of the film’s development is compelling in itself, considering that Richard Linklater has spent more than a decade making the movie. It follows the same cast of characters, played by the same group of actors, over the course of 12 years. Centered around one boy as his relationship with his divorced parents develops as he ages from seven to 19, it’s a movie-watching experience that’s as fresh and exciting as it is unshakably moving, according to ecstatic Sundance reviews.</p> <p><big><strong><em>Foxcatcher </em></strong></big><br/> Release Date: TBD</p> <p>Could Steve Carell be the next Nicole Kidman? Bear with me. In <em>Foxcatcher</em>, Carell plays John Du Pont, a paranoid schizophrenic who murders his wrestling champion brother (Mark Ruffalo). It’s a juicy role, based on the real-life Du Pont story. To transform physcially, Carell dons some intense prosthetics on his nose. If he transforms emotionally, too, we could have a new <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Hours-of-makeup-for-Kidman-2743177.php\">Kidman as Virginia Woolf</a> Oscar situation. The movie could be a Best Picture player, too, with <em>Moneyball</em>’s Bennett Miller at the helm.</p> <p><big><strong><em>Inherent Vice</em></strong></big><br/> Release Date: TBD</p> <p>No working actor is making as many bold decisions as Joaquin Phoenix has been recently, which means that no working actor has delivered performances as consistently daring, interesting, offbeat, and, in turn, transfixing as Phoenix, either. <em>Inherent Vice</em> reunites the <em>Her </em>star with director Paul Thomas Anderson, with whom he’s done his strangest and best work (<em>The Master</em>). It’s an adaptation of Thomas Pynchon’s own darkly comic novel, and co-stars Reese Witherspoon and Benicio Del Toro, both Oscar winners.</p> <p><big><strong><em>The Imitation Game</em></strong></big><br/> Release Date: TBD</p> <p>Benedict Cumberbatch has been on the edge of awards contention for years, playing small parts in major works like <em>Atonement</em>, <em>War Horse</em>, <em>Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</em>, and, this past year, <em>12 Years a Slave</em> and <em>August: Osage County</em>. He’s getting his starring turn, finally, in <em>The Imitation Game</em>, and it’s a role as complex as Cumberbatch’s skills demand. He play Alan Turing, a cryptographer in WWII who helped crack the Nazi code before being prosecuted for homosexuality. At best, expect one of those sweeping, character-driven war epics that the Academy can’t resist.</p> <p><big><strong><em>Knight of Cups</em></strong></big><br/> Release Date: TBD</p> <p><em>Knight of Cups </em>is a Terrence Malick film, which means that details on it are frustratingly thin. Incredibly robust, however, is the talent Malick has lined up for it, including Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale, Rooney Mara, Natalie Portman, Michael Fassbender, and Cate Blanchett, coming off her <em>Blue Jasmine </em>Oscar win. The plot is said to concern themes of celebrities and excess—so with such an excess of celebrities in the mix, things could get interesting.</p><img width='1' height='1' src='http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/37dc07ed/sc/13/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fentertainment%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fthe-oscars-in-2015-very-very-early-predictions-for-next-years-awards%2F284243%2F&t=The+Oscars+in+2015%3A+Very%2C+Very+Early+Predictions+for+Next+Year%27s+Awards\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png\" border=\"0\" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fentertainment%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fthe-oscars-in-2015-very-very-early-predictions-for-next-years-awards%2F284243%2F&t=The+Oscars+in+2015%3A+Very%2C+Very+Early+Predictions+for+Next+Year%27s+Awards\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png\" border=\"0\" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fentertainment%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fthe-oscars-in-2015-very-very-early-predictions-for-next-years-awards%2F284243%2F&t=The+Oscars+in+2015%3A+Very%2C+Very+Early+Predictions+for+Next+Year%27s+Awards\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png\" border=\"0\" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fentertainment%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fthe-oscars-in-2015-very-very-early-predictions-for-next-years-awards%2F284243%2F&t=The+Oscars+in+2015%3A+Very%2C+Very+Early+Predictions+for+Next+Year%27s+Awards\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png\" border=\"0\" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fentertainment%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fthe-oscars-in-2015-very-very-early-predictions-for-next-years-awards%2F284243%2F&t=The+Oscars+in+2015%3A+Very%2C+Very+Early+Predictions+for+Next+Year%27s+Awards\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png\" border=\"0\" /></a></td><td valign='middle'></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531451858/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dc07ed/sc/13/rc/1/rc.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531451858/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dc07ed/sc/13/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531451858/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dc07ed/sc/13/rc/2/rc.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531451858/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dc07ed/sc/13/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531451858/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dc07ed/sc/13/rc/3/rc.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531451858/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dc07ed/sc/13/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531451858/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dc07ed/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531451858/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dc07ed/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186531451858/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dc07ed/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/rPBJ0p4Kxek\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", "permalinkUrl" : "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/rPBJ0p4Kxek/story01.htm", "standardLinks" : { "alternate" : [ { "title" : "The Oscars in 2015: Very, Very Early Predictions for Next Year's Awards", "rel" : "alternate", "href" : "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/rPBJ0p4Kxek/story01.htm", "type" : "text/html" } ], "thumbnail" : [ { "title" : "The Oscars in 2015: Very, Very Early Predictions for Next Year's Awards", "rel" : "thumbnail", "href" : "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/newsroom/img/mt/2014/03/oscars2015/thumb.jpg?n1zk5t", "type" : "image/jpeg" } ], "canonical" : [ { "title" : "The Oscars in 2015: Very, Very Early Predictions for Next Year's Awards", "rel" : "canonical", "href" : "http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/37dc07ed/sc/13/l/0L0Stheatlantic0N0Centertainment0Carchive0C20A140C0A30Cthe0Eoscars0Ein0E20A150Every0Every0Eearly0Epredictions0Efor0Enext0Eyears0Eawards0C2842430C/story01.htm", "type" : "text/html" } ] }, "actor" : { "displayName" : "Kevin Fallon", "id" : "Kevin Fallon" }, "categories" : [ "Entertainment" ], "_id" : { "$oid" : "531874ce6662b5901c822b38" } }

Earlier this week, Ben Bernanke, former chairman of the U.S. central bank, took the stage at a conference in the United Arab Emirates and made “at least” $250,000. The previous year, as Fed chair, he’d only made $199,700. He made more speaking for 40 minutes—not even giving a speech, just being <em>in conversation</em>—than he did stewarding the world’s largest economy for a year.</p> <p>What does that mean? Well, take a look at the photo above. It’s provided by Reuters’s news service, and it shows Bernanke speaking at the forum. While we don’t have the exact exposure information, the photograph shows a starkly lit stage. We can guess that the shutter opened for between 1/40th and 1/60th of a second. Let’s round it to 1/50th, and say that the photo above captures 20 milliseconds of action, 20 milliseconds of light.</p> <p><strong>During the period of time captured in the photo above—between the time the shutter opened and closed—Ben Bernanke made a little more than $2.08.</strong></p> <p><span>Even if we've wildly misguessed the shutter speed, he’s making between one and three dollars in the time captured above. And though, of course, speakers’s fees cover more than his minutes onstage, that figure still conveys the worth of his time.</span></p> <p>There are three observations you can make, I think, about this lordly sum:</p> <p>1. President Obama is currently proposing a minimum hourly wage of $10.10. In one second of his talk, Ben Bernanke made just a little less than 10 times that.</p> <p>2. This was Bernanke’s first public appearance since stepping down as the American central banker. The last Fed chair, Alan Greenspan, only spoke privately and to small groups for a while after the end of his tenure. Bernanke’s seeming openness is a big deal—and maybe it deserves big compensation.</p> <p>Over the past decade or so, speaking fees have exploded. Speechifying conferences and smart-sounding lecture circuits have followed:<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Inconvenient_Truth\"> A PowerPoint won an Oscar</a>; folks watch TED talks for fun. This isn’t to cast aspersions: <em>The Atlantic</em> has a bustling (and successful) events schedule (as do <em>The New Yorker</em>, the <em>New York Times</em>, and many others), which I and my colleagues participate in. In the 2010s, events seem like a mechanism for spreading ideas and making money.</p> <p>Why is that? I wouldn’t want to say for sure, but I wonder if inequality—not just of wealth, but of prestige—is so vast, that there are so many different ways to unsuccessfully reach a famous person, that actually getting <em>their body in the room</em> is the only sure way to communicate with them. It’s the only sure way to have them hear you out—and for you to hear them out—and therefore it’s the most expensive.</p> <p>I wonder, in other words, if question-and-answer sessions (or their schmoozey, post-talk equivalent) drive the price of speaking fees.</p> <p>3. A few years ago, <em>The Atlantic</em>’s Matt O’Brien examined just <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/04/how-much-is-a-good-central-banker-worth/256089/\">how much a good central banker is worth</a>. It seems that, even though being the <a href=\"http://theweek.com/article/index/250797/janet-yellen-is-about-to-become-the-most-powerful-woman-in-us-history\">“second most powerful person in the world”</a> is something of a prestige position, we still way, <em>way</em> underpay our central bankers. Matt <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/04/how-much-is-a-good-central-banker-worth/256089/\">writes</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Central banking should be a superstar profession. The difference between a top central banker and an average one can be astronomical, particularly when conventional policy is impotent. An efficient market would pay them accordingly. If the United States spent $10 billion assembling a central banking fantasy lineup […], it would probably be a phenomenal investment. It'd pay for itself many, many times over.</p> </blockquote> <p>Maybe it’s worth thinking about Bernanke’s quarter-of-a-million-dollar chaser as another avenue of compensation, as a way of saving American taxpayers money. Besides, “former U.S. central bank president” speaking fees are nothing compared to those for “former U.S. <em>presidents.</em>” In 2011, Bill Clinton <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/03/politics/clinton-speaking-fees/\">raked in some $750,000</a> for a single speech in Hong Kong.</p><img width='1' height='1'

But the song is about as warm and soothing as rock music gets. “Take it slowly, brother,” the adventurous Canadian mews. “Let it go, now, brother. Go home.” Languid guitars sort of wade in the mix, just barely above an ambling bass line and a comforting 4/4 beat. DeMarco is only 23, but here and elsewhere on his forthcoming album <em>Salad Days</em>—out April 1 on Captured Tracks—he seems wiser than his years suggest. He seems to get that the simplest message—“take it slowly,” etc.—is often the most profound.</p> <iframe frameborder=\"no\" scrolling=\"no\"

Is it really so ridiculous to believe that the Syria crisis confirmed certain impressions that Putin had already cultivated about America’s willingness to back up its threats and see a given strategy through, and that this influenced his decision to push harder in Ukraine than this White House... expected?\"</p> <p>Could that be true, as far as it goes? \"This push isn’t 'about us' in the sense that, say, Russia’s decision-making in the Cuban Missile Crisis was,\" Douthat adds, \"but Putin surely took account of the steps that the U.S. and its allies were likely to undertake in response, and decided that they would be less effective, and less painful to his interests, than our own foreign policy team clearly expected him to think.\" Well, I don't think this logic takes us very far at all toward hawkish positions. </p> <p>Say that Putin learned, as a result of nonintervention in Syria, that the Obama Administration won't start risky wars that don't serve U.S. interests merely to save face. That plausibly increased Putin's certainty that the U.S. wouldn't respond to aggression against Ukraine by declaring war on Russia–that would constitute an even more costly use of force on behalf of a decidedly peripheral interest. </p> <p>See where I'm going?</p> <p>In theory, some past Obama Administration action could've persuaded Putin that we <em>might</em> respond militarily, causing him to refrain from his invasion of Crimea.</p> <p>But if so, that action would've damaged us, because only a risky intervention with costs that far outweighed benefits would've made the necessary point: that we may well do something that's reckless and irrational. And even that attempt to establish what we're calling \"credibility\" wouldn't necessarily be successful. After all, striking Syria and warring with Russia, to stick with our example, are still different. It's no coincidence that the Syria hawks who think U.S. nonintervention emboldened Putin <em>don't themselves favor a military response in Crimea</em>. </p> <p>They just believe if we had acted in Syria, Putin would be fooled into thinking that we'd act if he invaded Crimea. Why they think that is beyond my comprehension. If an intervention is so foolhardy that even Bill Kristol opposes it, it's hard to imagine a scenario in which a foreign leader would bet on us jumping in.  </p> <p>Now, perhaps there is a theoretical instance in which the threshold for taking action in one country is crossed, just barely, because it will help us to bluff in a different circumstance. But that gambit seems like an awfully questionable rationale for starting a war. Hawks nevertheless encourage such an approach so frequently that it's as if they regard it as a mainstay of sound geopolitical strategy. </p> <p>If you need a refresher on the time they got to try things their way, Ted Galen <a href=\"http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/bomb-syria-intimidate-iran-recycling-bad-idea-9078?page=1\">can help</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>Richard Perle <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/gunning/interviews/perle.html\">insisted</a> that having already destroyed the Taliban in Afghanistan, moving against Saddam’s regime would send the message to Iran (and other supporters of terrorism such as Syria and Libya) that “‘You’re next.’ Two words. Very efficient diplomacy.”</p> <p data-uninsertable=\"has-special-tag\"><i>Washington Post</i><span> columnist Charles Krauthammer contended that the United States could best accelerate an anti-clerical revolution in Iran by conducting successful military campaigns in nearby states, especially Iraq. “Overthrowing neighboring radical regimes shows the fragility of dictatorship, challenges the mullahs’ mandate from heaven and thus encourages disaffected Iranians to rise,” Krauthammer </span><a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/research/2013/03/19/where-are-the-medias-iraq-war-boosters-10-years/193117%20%20\">argued</a><span>. “First, Afghanistan to the east. Next, Iraq to the west.”</span><span>The ubiquitous Bill Kristol </span><a href=\"http://www.newamericancentury.org/defense-20020207.htm\">insisted</a><span> that the potential “political, strategic and moral rewards” of invading Iraq would be great. Among other benefits, a “friendly, free, and oil-producing Iraq would leave Iran isolated.” American Enterprise Institute writers Gary Schmitt and Tom Donnelly </span><a href=\"http://www.newamericancentury.org/Schmitt_Donnelly-091701.pdf\">predicted</a><span>: “Defeating the Saddam/Bin Laden axis will send a broader message as well. It will deter Iran, Syria, and the other part-time members of the anti-American coalition in the Middle East.”</span></p> </blockquote> <p>If America was, in fact, willing to war for a particular cause–the territorial integrity of Canada, say–it would certainly be worthwhile to make sure we've clearly signaled as much. But signaling with actual war to make a bluff more credible? The most likely outcome is that you fight dumb wars and send a signal of incompetence.</p><img width='1' height='1' src='http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/37dc1333/sc/20/mf.gif'

This means humans, too. Hunger makes animals alert and irritable, which explains why couples always fight about where to eat dinner. This emotional response encourages the animals to find food.</p> <p>But all this is only in the broadest, most primal “eating = good, not eating = bad” way. The details of the relationship between foods and moods end up being a little contradictory and a lot complicated.</p> <p>What we tend to think of as “emotional eating” is a specific kind of eating and a specific kind of emotion—eating sugary, fatty, carb-y, unhealthy foods as a coping mechanism for feeling upset.  In reality, “emotional eating” is a much broader term.</p> <p>“We eat for a variety of different emotions and we eat in a variety of different circumstances which are in turn connected with emotions,” Meryl Gardner, a marketing professor at the University of Delaware, says.</p> <p>Gardner was the lead author on a <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057740814000060\">new study</a> published in the <em>Journal of Consumer Psychology, </em>which looked at food choice and mood, adding to a fairly extensive body of research that already exists on the interplay between moods and foods.</p> <p>There seems to be a clear, fairly consistent connection between negative emotions and unhealthy foods, though there are individual variations for what <em>kind</em> of snack people want. In a bad mood, people’s hands tend to float to the cookie jar, the candy bag, the snack drawer. What’s less clear is what foods we’re drawn to in a positive mood.</p> <p>Some studies say we still want treats. A <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/?&fa=main.doiLanding&doi=10.1037/0021-843X.101.2.348\">1992 study</a> and a <a href=\"http://ac.els-cdn.com/S019566630290499X/1-s2.0-S019566630290499X-main.pdf?_tid=edbdeba6-a479-11e3-a8a5-00000aacb360&acdnat=1394033113_c88ed7a56c3e1767060124c3588f4ec2\">2002 study</a> (one on women, one on men) found that joy led to increased consumption of indulgent foods. A 2013 study in <em>Appetite</em> titled “<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019566631300130X\">Happy Eating: The underestimated role of overeating in a positive mood</a>” points out the potential for increased consumption (in this case of chips and chocolate) when we’re feeling good.</p> <p>Other research says just the opposite—that we’re more likely to eschew the sugar/carb rush when happy. In 2010, <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.1086/655665?uid=3739256&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21103592979347\">researchers found</a> that people in a positive mood were more likely to choose grapes over chocolate than those in a neutral mood. <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.1086/597159?uid=3739256&uid=2&uid=4&sid=21103592979347\">Another study</a> offers a qualification, finding that people would choose healthy foods if they felt like their good mood was going to stick around; if not, they might eat more indulgent foods, to keep the good vibes going.</p> <p>Gardner’s study also found a connection between negative moods and unhealthy foods, and positive moods and healthy foods, but she and her team introduced the element of time into the equation as well. They had participants think about either the present or the future (by describing their current residence, or a possible future residence). They found that regardless of mood, long-term, future-focused thinking led to healthier choices.</p> <p>“When you’re in a good mood, you take a longer-term perspective,” Gardner says. “You see the forest, not the trees... When you’re focused on the near term, when you’re looking at what’s in front of your nose, you respond with what’s going to give you quick pleasure. And that’s triggered very much by bad moods. But we can fight that.”</p> <p>Dr. Leigh Gibson, a psychology professor at the University of Roehampton in London, disagrees, though he says he finds those results interesting. “I’m not sure that’s the way people normally go about their daily eating,” he says. “For habitual behaviors like eating, there tends to be an intention-behavior gap. We have all these wonderful intentions, but when it comes down to it, we’re exposed to energy-dense foods when we find ourselves hungry.”</p> <p>It does seem unlikely that most of us would take the time to describe our future homes to ourselves before deciding on pizza or a salad for lunch. And as previously noted, there is little consensus on what we typically crave when we’re happy.</p> <p>Part of the reason why it seems our moods rarely drive us toward healthy foods, Gibson says, is that for much of human history, energy-dense foods, or what we now consider comfort foods, were the ideal thing to eat.</p> <p>“We didn’t evolve as homo sapiens by eating healthy, because all we had to do was reproduce and survive until our mid-20’s,” he says. “We were quite happily sucking the marrow out of bones. We were just getting energy, protein, the basic nutrients we needed, but we didn’t have to live too long. Healthy eating is a modern, cultural thing that we now need, because we’re living so long… You could almost say the default is comfort eating.”</p> <p>We’re not constantly shoveling mashed potatoes into our mouths (at least not most of the time), so of course this doesn’t mean that humans don’t ever choose healthy foods, just that when we do, it might not be in response to our emotions.</p> <p>Another reason for this lack of consensus is that there are a variety of moods that can fit under the “positive” umbrella—feeling excited is very different from feeling content, and those emotions could lead to similarly divergent food choices.</p> <p>For example, Gardner says we tend to go for special, often unhealthy, foods on celebratory occasions, like birthdays or Thanksgiving.</p> <p>“You eat the birthday cake, you may go out in the evening and eat more appetizers and drink more cocktails than you intended, and it’s all part of the specialness of the occasion,” she says. “And we’ve all learned to celebrate with food. It’s part of so many different cultures.”</p> <p>Carol Landau—a clinical professor of psychiatry, human behavior, and medicine at Brown University—points out that some comfort eaters turn everything into a celebration, rewarding themselves with food not just for special occasions, but for everyday accomplishments as well.</p> <p>“Food is such an important part of culture,” Landau says. “I think we’re asking people to do a lot [by asking them] to avoid comfort eating.”</p> <p>Gibson says this sort of celebratory eating seems to be more prevalent for men than women. There’s also some evidence that the foods men and women turn to for comfort are different—men often get more comfort from savory foods and “general meal-type foods,” Gibson says, as opposed to snacks. Gardner says she has also found men to be more drawn to salty foods.</p> <p>Sweet foods, however, seem to be a universal crowd-pleaser.</p> <p>“Sweetness is such a powerful stimulus,” Gibson says. “We’re born initially liking sweetness. It probably helps [that babies] have an appetite for breast milk and so on.”</p> <p>This may well be why the go-to image of comfort eating in culture is someone crying into a pint of Ben & Jerry’s, and why so many studies on mood and food choice include chocolate as one of the unhealthy options.</p> <p>“If one can characterize [comfort] foods in any simple way, it would be that they’re typically energy-dense,” Gibson says. “Therefore they’re probably high fat, and they might be sweet as well. The perfect comfort food might be chocolate.”</p> <p>But as we all know, the positive effects of eating sweets are short-lived. Whether it’s a crash that comes after a sugar high, or just a feeling of guilt after eating more cookies than you planned, treats are not a ticket to long-term happiness.</p> <p>So in the chicken-or-the-egg problem of food and mood, do the moods hatch the foods, or do the foods hatch the moods? Studies disagree—the relationship seems to go both ways. A couple recent studies suggest that the foods come first.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019566631100643X\">study published in 2012</a>, Penn State psychology professor Dr. Helen Hendy had 44 undergraduate students keep week-long diaries of how they felt and what they ate. She analyzed the results in terms of four things the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend we should limit to improve physical health: calories, carbohydrates, saturated fat, and sodium. Following those recommendations, Hendy found, seemed to have benefits for improving moods as well.</p> <p>She found that the link between foods and moods played out over a period of two days—what you ate on day one was linked to how you felt on day three, etc. As usual, the correlation was more consistent with negative moods: “Consumption of calories, saturated fat, and sodium was significantly associated with increased negative mood two days later,” the study reads.</p> <p>“Some of my research leads me to change my habits, and this one has,” Hendy says. “I have a big meeting [in two days], so today I’m going to watch my calories, my sodium, and my saturated fat, so I can hopefully have a chance to be in a good mood.”</p> <p>A similar study, <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjhp.12021/abstract\">published in the <em>British Journal of Health Psychology</em></a> in 2013, had 281 undergrads keep a 21-day diary, and did find a correlation between eating fruits and vegetables one day and being in a positive mood the next day. The association with eating fruit was stronger for men, but both men and women benefitted from eating veggies. Participants’ BMI did not affect the association.</p> <p>The exact reasons why healthy eating might make you happy are unclear, but Gibson posits that if you intend to eat healthily, and you follow through, that could put you in a good mood. “Achieving goals is part and parcel of emotional experience,” he says.</p> <p>Both eating and emotion are such regular, consistent parts of our lives that it’s inevitable they would get tangled up together. Unfortunately, though research has illuminated some interesting possibilities as to how they relate to one another, the knot is still very much intact and it’s hard to see where one ends and the other begins.</p> <p>“There’s not a very neat story there,” Gibson says. Regardless, there’s a bit more to it than just feeling sad and therefore reaching for a spoon and some ice cream, or whatever your preferred unhealthy snack is. It seems entirely possible that all eating is, in fact, emotional eating. </p><img width='1' height='1' src='http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/37dcb9f6/sc/14/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Four-moods-our-foods%2F284238%2F&t=Our+Moods%2C+Our+Foods\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png\" border=\"0\" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Four-moods-our-foods%2F284238%2F&t=Our+Moods%2C+Our+Foods\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png\" border=\"0\" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Four-moods-our-foods%2F284238%2F&t=Our+Moods%2C+Our+Foods\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png\" border=\"0\" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Four-moods-our-foods%2F284238%2F&t=Our+Moods%2C+Our+Foods\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png\" border=\"0\" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fhealth%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Four-moods-our-foods%2F284238%2F&t=Our+Moods%2C+Our+Foods\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png\" border=\"0\" /></a></td><td valign='middle'></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531454551/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dcb9f6/sc/14/rc/1/rc.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531454551/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dcb9f6/sc/14/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531454551/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dcb9f6/sc/14/rc/2/rc.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531454551/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dcb9f6/sc/14/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531454551/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dcb9f6/sc/14/rc/3/rc.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531454551/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dcb9f6/sc/14/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531454551/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dcb9f6/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531454551/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dcb9f6/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186531454551/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dcb9f6/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/M4xXnCbIbgc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", "permalinkUrl" : "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/M4xXnCbIbgc/story01.htm", "standardLinks" : { "alternate" : [ { "title" : "Our Moods, Our Foods", "rel" : "alternate", "href" : "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/M4xXnCbIbgc/story01.htm", "type" : "text/html" } ], "thumbnail" : [ { "title" : "Our Moods, Our Foods", "rel" : "thumbnail", "href" : "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/newsroom/img/mt/2014/03/Untitled_1/thumb.jpg?n1z79u", "type" : "image/jpeg" } ], "canonical" : [ { "title" : "Our Moods, Our Foods", "rel" : "canonical", "href" : "http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/37dcb9f6/sc/14/l/0L0Stheatlantic0N0Chealth0Carchive0C20A140C0A30Cour0Emoods0Eour0Efoods0C2842380C/story01.htm", "type" : "text/html" } ] }, "actor" : { "displayName" : "Julie Beck", "id" : "Julie Beck" }, "categories" : [ "Health" ], "_id" : { "$oid" : "5318827d6662b5901c822b44" } }

Another post of mine cited an amicus brief by Eugene Volokh <a href=\"http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/Elane-Photog-filed-brief.pdf\">arguing</a> that \"photographers, artists, singers, writers, and other creators of expression have a First Amendment right to choose which expression they want to create,\" and that protecting free expression \"would not block the enforcement of anti-discrimination law when it comes to discriminatory denials of service by caterers, hotels that rent out space for weddings, limousine service operators, and the like.\" On Twitter, I've also recommended Julian Sanchez's <a href=\"http://www.juliansanchez.com/2014/02/27/discriminating-between-discriminations/\">analysis</a> on this subject.</p> <p>My failure to reflexively insist that anti-discrimination laws, some of which I support, invariably trump all other societal interests, and my insistence that there are both similarities <em>and</em> <em>huge</em> <em>differences</em> between what blacks faced circa 1960 and what gays and lesbians face today, have caused some readers to draw an inaccurate conclusion: that I believe it's basically unobjectionable for a photographer (say), when motivated by sincere religious belief, to boycott same sex weddings.  </p> <p>Actually, I very much object! Such a photographer has, I think, reached wrongheaded conclusions. I just don't think vilification or fines are justified. Such remedies may be needed, in a given instance, to address anti-gay discrimination. If gays in America were being turned away from restaurants or hotel rooms as a class, if a private ambulance company refused to answer emergency calls from a gay wedding venue, or if a local government agency were discriminating against gays and lesbians in hiring, I'd happily endorse a coerced legal remedy.</p> <p>The burden imposed on gays in the case we're discussing–very occassionally having to choose a different wedding vendor for a subset of nuptial services provided by professionals engaged in expressive activity covered by the 1st Amendment–is thankfully tiny in comparison to historic uses of nondiscrimination law.</p> <p>Again, that isn't to say I think it's right to discriminate against gay weddings in this way–I think it's wrong, and that the best remedy in these sorts of cases is persuasion. </p> <p>Remember that wonderful liberal tool?</p> <p>There can be no denying that persuasion has radically changed the attitudes of Americans toward gays and lesbians in recent years. So many grandparents and parents I know have been persuaded by their children to let go of long held prejudices and stereotypes. Everyone heartened by the spread of gay marriage, as I am, or encouraged by the backlash against anti-gay bullying, which ought to grow stronger still, can take heart in the fact that every trend is moving in the right direction. </p> <p>Yet there is widespread dismissal of persuasion as a serious remedy–and a similarly confounding certainty that fining photographers will prove more effective, even though non-discrimination law has arguably done far less for gay equality.</p> <p>Well, let's try persuasion, if only in this space.</p> <p>I'd very much like to persuade the tiny subset of Christian professionals who feel conscience-bound to decline business from same sex marriages to reconsider their position. For familiarity's sake, I'll stick with the example of a photographer, a creative professional that represents the most difficult case for my view.</p> <p>Unlike a hotel owner or a convenience store manager, a wedding photographer is often a sole proprietor who works closely with clients on an interpersonal level. One way of understanding the role is a charge to make the wedding itself look good, using some combination of personal artistic vision and technical training.</p> <p>An orthodox Christian photographer with a traditionalist, procreative understanding of marriage might feel that, by using her artistic talent on a same sex wedding, she would be glorifying something she believes to be sinful; alternatively, such a photographer might feel that there is a falseness to using her artistry to portray as a marriage ceremony something she believes is nothing of the sort. </p> <p>But there is a different way of looking at things, and I invite religious photographers to consider it, because I believe it is analytically sound and more Christian.</p> <p>In this view, a wedding photographer's charge is to capture the reality of an event as the couple is experiencing it. Doing so to the satisfaction of the client doesn't require believing that an actual marriage is taking place, any more than photographing a First Communion requires the photographer to believe that the child is actually consuming the body of Christ. It is enough, at the Communion, to capture the joyful tear on the cheek of the mother and the awe in the child's eyes. </p> <p>I ask you, Christians, should a Buddhist photographer be able to joyfully capture that moment, even while staying true to their beliefs, out of love for fellow humans?</p> <p>It is more than enough, for a wedding photographer, to capture the love that exists between the participants; the joyfulness of their families; the aesthetically pleasing way that the setting sun shone on the dinner tables with their unique centerpieces; the laughter on the faces of the assembled during the charming toasts. </p> <p>Even at the moment when the rings are exchanged two people are showing <em>love</em> to each other!</p> <p>An orthodox Christian photographer will not believe that she witnessed a marriage, and might disapprove of honeymoon activities to come. But isn't there quite a lot for that photographer to celebrate, even at a same sex wedding where she finds the claim to matrimony to be problematic and wrongheaded? Isn't it right to glory in any moment when, inspired by love, people commit to honor and care for one another in good times and bad, in sickness and in health, for life?</p> <p>Isn't there always reason to celebrate an extended family gathering together, where the elderly can smile at the little ones playing as nephews indulge their aunts with a dance? Isn't there something divine in a dozen old friends gathering together for a meal, their hearts grateful for the presence of one another? A photographer who captured all that would earn her fee without betraying her faith. And don't Jesus' teachings commend us to associate with people even when we believe them to be sinners? Aside from sinning oneself, isn't going as far as one can to accommodate others exactly what Christ's actions ought to inspire?</p> <p>Christian photographers should take pictures at gay weddings with a clear conscience. But if a tiny subset searches their conscience and decides, in spite of my arguments, that they cannot, legal sanction shouldn't await them, just more persuasion, which isn't, as many would have you believe, tantamount to doing nothing. Persuasion can affirm the equal dignity that gay marriages deserve to enjoy. And it may well produce more effective results than fining Christian photographers.</p><img width='1' height='1' src='http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/37dcb9f8/sc/38/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fwhy-christian-photographers-should-work-at-gay-weddings%2F284254%2F&t=Why+Christian+Photographers+Should+Work+at+Gay+Weddings\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png\" border=\"0\" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fwhy-christian-photographers-should-work-at-gay-weddings%2F284254%2F&t=Why+Christian+Photographers+Should+Work+at+Gay+Weddings\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png\" border=\"0\" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fwhy-christian-photographers-should-work-at-gay-weddings%2F284254%2F&t=Why+Christian+Photographers+Should+Work+at+Gay+Weddings\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png\" border=\"0\" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fwhy-christian-photographers-should-work-at-gay-weddings%2F284254%2F&t=Why+Christian+Photographers+Should+Work+at+Gay+Weddings\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png\" border=\"0\" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fwhy-christian-photographers-should-work-at-gay-weddings%2F284254%2F&t=Why+Christian+Photographers+Should+Work+at+Gay+Weddings\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png\" border=\"0\" /></a></td><td valign='middle'></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531454549/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dcb9f8/sc/38/rc/1/rc.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531454549/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dcb9f8/sc/38/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531454549/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dcb9f8/sc/38/rc/2/rc.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531454549/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dcb9f8/sc/38/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531454549/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dcb9f8/sc/38/rc/3/rc.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531454549/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dcb9f8/sc/38/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531454549/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dcb9f8/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531454549/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dcb9f8/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186531454549/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dcb9f8/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/5b83inDsaLg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", "permalinkUrl" : "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/5b83inDsaLg/story01.htm", "standardLinks" : { "alternate" : [ { "title" : "Why Christian Photographers Should Work at Gay Weddings", "rel" : "alternate", "href" : "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/5b83inDsaLg/story01.htm", "type" : "text/html" } ], "thumbnail" : [ { "title" : "Why Christian Photographers Should Work at Gay Weddings", "rel" : "thumbnail", "href" : "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/newsroom/img/mt/2014/03/camera/thumb.png?n20o4h", "type" : "image/jpeg" } ], "canonical" : [ { "title" : "Why Christian Photographers Should Work at Gay Weddings", "rel" : "canonical", "href" : "http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/37dcb9f8/sc/38/l/0L0Stheatlantic0N0Cpolitics0Carchive0C20A140C0A30Cwhy0Echristian0Ephotographers0Eshould0Ework0Eat0Egay0Eweddings0C2842540C/story01.htm", "type" : "text/html" } ] }, "actor" : { "displayName" : "Conor Friedersdorf", "id" : "Conor Friedersdorf" }, "categories" : [ "Politics" ], "_id" : { "$oid" : "5318827d6662b5901c822b45" } }

In the years since, the ability to choose deferred rewards over smaller immediate rewards has been associated with numerous positives such as enhanced self-esteem, academic excellence, and physical fitness. </p> <p>Marine biologist Ayana Elizabeth Johnson speculates that this trait may also have something to do with being better at environmental stewardship.</p> <p>Johnson thinks a lot about how humans interact with ocean resources (like fish), and what drives us to exploit or conserve these resources. One question she returns to, over and over, is: How can we enable people to take a long-term view when it comes to the wealth of the oceans—\"to save some for later, to use the ocean without using it up?\"</p> <p>The answer to that question has more to do with people and the psychology of human decision-making than it does with fish and ecology. So, while doing field work in Curacao and Bonaire for her marine biology Ph.D., Johnson ended up designing a behavioral economics study. The <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800914000081\">results</a> were published last week in the journal <a href=\"http://www.journals.elsevier.com/ecological-economics\"><em>Ecological Economics</em></a>. </p> <p>It's common knowledge today that fisheries around the world are collapsing—a huge portion of them are either overfished (being harvested too heavily for their populations to keep reproducing properly) or operating at maximum capacity (on the brink of being overfished). It's a situation that threatens the livelihoods of millions of people and is already dragging down the global economy. That fisheries are capable of recovering if certain actions are taken —establishing marine reserves, using different fishing gear, reducing the government subsidies that incentivize overfishing—is also becoming well-known. What is <em>not</em> well-known or fully understood yet is that there are several reasons, rooted in behavioral psychology, why the people who stand to benefit most from these actions may resist them.</p> <p>As Johnson explains, many fishing communities are severely constrained by poverty. The circumstances of poverty \"lead people to make decisions that are not sustainable for long-term vibrant fisheries.\" The reality is not that they \"don't care about the environment\"; it's that \"they need to care more at the moment about how they’re going to feed their family, put food on the table, pay their bills, and make ends meet,\" says Johnson. Their current financial conditions necessitate short-term rather than long-term thinking. </p> <p>Johnson engaged with over 350 fishermen and SCUBA divers in Curacao and Bonaire in a way quite similar to how the Stanford researchers engaged with American children in the marshmallow experiment. Johnson asked her subjects to choose between receiving 50 U.S. dollars in two weeks or some incrementally fewer number of dollars immediately to test their <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_preference\">time preferences</a>, or how much they valued short-term gains over long-term gains. A subject, given the choice between $50 in two weeks or $45 that same day, might choose to take $45. When asked if he would prefer $40 that day instead of $50 later, he might still favor the immediate payout. When forced to consider the difference between $35 immediately and $50 later, though, he might change his mind and decide to wait.</p> <!-- START \"MORE ON\" SINGLE STORY BOX v. 2 --> <!-- END \"MORE ON\" SINGLE STORY BOX v. 2 --><p>Wherever that shift occurred, whether it was at the $35 price point or higher or lower, revealed something about the subject's attitudes toward money. (It also revealed, in aggregate, that in Curacao and Bonaire, the price of beer is an important financial reference point for many people. Johnson notes that some individuals chose between sooner and later payments \"based on whether or not they would be able to buy a case of beer with that amount of money.\" A case of Polar, the most popular beer on both islands, cost about $37 at the time of the study.)</p> <p>But, Johnson wanted to know, \"Do people think the same way about dollars as they do about fish?\" To figure that part out, she conducted exhaustive interviews with each subject to elicit information about his income, his family, and, most importantly, his willingness to support various conservation measures. For example, was a fisherman who had expressed financial impatience (a desire to accept $20 on the spot rather than wait for $50 in two weeks) more or less amenable to the idea of marine reserves (no-fishing zones that obviously restrict a fisherman's catch in the short-term but eventually lead to more abundance and higher catches overall, representing a delayed benefit)?</p> <p>After controlling for a host of demographic and economic factors, Johnson and her co-author, Dan Saunders, were able to isolate the relationship between interviewees' financial patience and attitudes toward conservation. The one strong correlation they discovered was this: Individuals who were less patient were also less supportive of marine reserves.</p> <p>The study's other findings—that fishermen and SCUBA divers have different time preferences and different attitudes toward conservation, and that it matters whether one lives on Curacao or Bonaire—are best considered in context of the interviewees' socio-cultural-economic backgrounds.</p> <p>Overall, the fishermen demonstrated slightly less financial patience than the divers. And the divers were more supportive of all conservation measures—not just the marine reserves—than the fishermen. Both groups depend on the ocean for their income, but in different ways and to different degrees. The fishermen make money by taking fish <em>out</em> of the ocean. The divers make money by taking tourists to look at the fish <em>in</em> the ocean. The divers tend to be young, unmarried, white, non-native (many of them are Dutch), financially secure—they may only be diving part-time, for fun, they may have support from their parents, and they rarely have children of their own—and have less personal and family history in their field than fishers. In contrast, the fishermen are older, they're Antillean, they're heads of families, they depend on fishing to support their families, \"and are just in a very different financial situation,\" says Johnson. They have less access to credit and are \"less likely to even have a friend who would loan them 50 bucks—and if they did, that friend would often charge them interest!\" For these reasons, she wasn't surprised that the fishermen were less patient. </p> <p>Residents of Curacao and Bonaire also have different relationships with the sea. Bonaire has a long history of marine preservation, including a <a href=\"http://www.bmp.org/history.html\">national marine park</a> that was established in 1979. Curacao has not yet established a similar conservation zone. And Bonaire depends, economically, much more on diving tourism than Curacao. </p> <p>Johnson and Saunders found that, on Bonaire, there was much more support for conservation measures among both fishermen and divers. Johnson attributes this to the presence of the marine park and a concept called \"conservation inertia.\" The residents of Bonaire have had the chance to witness the benefits of having a marine park. They've already gone through the process of making a short-term sacrifice for a long-term gain. It's hard to get people to make a sacrifice like that for the first time, to say, \"Okay, we'll give up this fishing area, and we know it might cause some economic pain briefly but we will see the benefits soon.\" However, says Johnson, because of conservation inertia, \"once people get over that first hurdle, and they feel in their pockets the benefits of conservation—whether that's more tourists coming or more fish—they're more likely to support similar measures in the future.\"</p> <p>But how can policymakers make it easier for individuals to accept short-term economic pain in exchange for long-term economic security? Figure out a way to make the short-term sacrifices hurt less. The idea of paying fishers to offset the short-term losses they'll experience during the transition to a more sustainable fishery—a fishery with restricted access, or that exists alongside a no-fishing zone, or in which certain types of gear are prohibited—ought to be considered not just as an idea but an essential component of any reform plan. </p><img width='1' height='1' src='http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/37dc8164/sc/14/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fbusiness%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fcan-the-famous-marshmallow-study-explain-environmental-conservation%2F284190%2F&t=Can+the+Famous+Marshmallow+Study+Explain+Environmental+Conservation%3F\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png\" border=\"0\" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fbusiness%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fcan-the-famous-marshmallow-study-explain-environmental-conservation%2F284190%2F&t=Can+the+Famous+Marshmallow+Study+Explain+Environmental+Conservation%3F\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png\" border=\"0\" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fbusiness%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fcan-the-famous-marshmallow-study-explain-environmental-conservation%2F284190%2F&t=Can+the+Famous+Marshmallow+Study+Explain+Environmental+Conservation%3F\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png\" border=\"0\" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fbusiness%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fcan-the-famous-marshmallow-study-explain-environmental-conservation%2F284190%2F&t=Can+the+Famous+Marshmallow+Study+Explain+Environmental+Conservation%3F\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png\" border=\"0\" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fbusiness%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fcan-the-famous-marshmallow-study-explain-environmental-conservation%2F284190%2F&t=Can+the+Famous+Marshmallow+Study+Explain+Environmental+Conservation%3F\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png\" border=\"0\" /></a></td><td valign='middle'></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531457104/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dc8164/sc/14/rc/1/rc.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531457104/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dc8164/sc/14/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531457104/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dc8164/sc/14/rc/2/rc.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531457104/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dc8164/sc/14/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531457104/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dc8164/sc/14/rc/3/rc.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531457104/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dc8164/sc/14/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531457104/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dc8164/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531457104/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dc8164/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186531457104/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37dc8164/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/ZTzPqX65h-o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", "permalinkUrl" : "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/ZTzPqX65h-o/story01.htm", "standardLinks" : { "alternate" : [ { "title" : "Can the Famous Marshmallow Study Explain Environmental Conservation?", "rel" : "alternate", "href" : "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/ZTzPqX65h-o/story01.htm", "type" : "text/html" } ], "thumbnail" : [ { "title" : "Can the Famous Marshmallow Study Explain Environmental Conservation?", "rel" : "thumbnail", "href" : "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/newsroom/img/mt/2014/03/translator_Dustin_Abraham_interviewing_oldest_fisher_on_Bonaire-1/thumb.jpg?n1zmpx", "type" : "image/jpeg" } ], "canonical" : [ { "title" : "Can the Famous Marshmallow Study Explain Environmental Conservation?", "rel" : "canonical", "href" : "http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/37dc8164/sc/14/l/0L0Stheatlantic0N0Cbusiness0Carchive0C20A140C0A30Ccan0Ethe0Efamous0Emarshmallow0Estudy0Eexplain0Eenvironmental0Econservation0C284190A0C/story01.htm", "type" : "text/html" } ] }, "actor" : { "displayName" : "Svati Kirsten Narula", "id" : "Svati Kirsten Narula" }, "categories" : [ "Business" ], "_id" : { "$oid" : "5318827d6662b5901c822b46" } }

By this point, his argument seems like a trope: All red-blooded men have watched porn. It's just part of life. Get used to it.</p> <p>Whether or not Savage is right about how often people watch porn, they don't seem to be \"getting used to it.\" According to data from the Public Religion Research Institute, only 29 percent of Americans think watching porn is morally acceptable. Somewhat predictably, men and women have very different opinions on the issue: Only 23 percent of women approve, while 35 percent of men think it's okay.</p> <p>These statistics suggest something wildly different from the Dan Savage view of the sex world. Even if it were true that all men watch porn at some point—which it probably isn't—65 percent of them feel bad about it.</p> <p>One striking thing about these findings is the incredible variation in how people think about porn on a personal level and how they think about it on a legal level. Overall, 39 percent said they'd oppose legal restrictions on pornography, compared to the 29 percent who consider it morally acceptable. That means roughly ten percent of people disapprove of porn but don't think it should be illegal. The demographic breakdown reveals some unanticipated nuance. A twentysomething and her grandma are just as likely to think access to porn shouldn't be restricted on the Internet (42 percent), but the Millennial is five times as likely to think watching it is morally okay (45 percent versus 9 percent). Democrats and Tea Partiers have similar attitudes about legal restrictions against porn (41 and 40 percent opposed, respectively), and Tea Partiers are much more morally forgiving of erotica than those on the right who just call themselves Republicans: 27 percent versus 19 percent say it's okay. (Earlier this week, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/03/lots-of-people-who-support-gay-marriage-think-gay-sex-is-immoral/284171/\">I noted a similar divide</a> in the PRRI survey between Americans who support a right to gay marriage while still disapproving of gay sex.)</p> <!-- START \"MORE ON\" SINGLE STORY BOX v. 2 --> <!-- END \"MORE ON\" SINGLE STORY BOX v. 2 --><p>Recent debates about the porn industry haven't seemed to take this ambivalence into account. A <a href=\"http://www.dukechronicle.com/articles/2014/02/14/portrait-porn-star\">Duke University freshman starred in hardcore porn videos</a> and <a href=\"http://www.xojane.com/sex/duke-university-freshman-porn-star\">took to the blogs to defend her right to do so</a>. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/03/david-cameron-internet-porn-filter-censorship-creep\">Editorials about Britain's new Internet porn filter</a> have focused on the government's right to regulate the web. Both of these are compelling and understandable points of concern, but they hinge on this issue of <em>rights</em>: The right to voluntarily work in the erotica industry without harassment, the right to enjoy sex work, the right to watch porn without interrogation from your government.</p> <p>These are all valid issues. But even if 18-year-olds are free to make sex tapes and middle-aged men are free to watch them without Big Brother's scrutiny, there is a lingering moral question: Is watching porn a good thing to do? </p> <p>Different groups have very different ways of answering this question. Some were predictable. White evangelicals and people over 68 are the least likely to approve of watching smut: 10 percent and 9 percent, respectively. On the opposite side of the spectrum, Millennials and people who consider themselves religiously unaffiliated approve of porn the most: 45 percent and 53 percent, respectively. </p> <p>But some trends are more surprising. White Catholics are twice as likely as Hispanic Catholics to find watching porn morally acceptable—28 versus 14 percent. People with an advanced degree are somewhat less likely than college graduates to think it's morally acceptable to watch (34 versus 40 percent). But both of those groups are significantly more likely than high-school grads to approve—only 23 percent of that group told PRRI it was okay. </p> <p>There were especially curious trends in how some groups saw the legal question versus the moral question. Roughly the same percentage of Generation X-ers (in this survey, people aged 34 to 48) feel like it's wrong and think it should be legally restricted, with 33 percent approving morally and 34 percent saying they'd oppose legal restrictions.<strong> </strong>Among Hispanic Catholics, on the other hand, only 14 percent approve morally, but 66 percent say they'd oppose legal restrictions. </p> <p class=\"pullquote\">Most Americans simply don't approve of porn, in any sense.</p> <p>There could be a shame factor at work. Just because people disapprove of something doesn't mean they don't do it—almost certainly, at least a few of the people who said they think watching porn is wrong still indulge once in a while. Respondents might have been ashamed to say they approve of porn on a poll question, or they might have been answering on behalf of their \"better selves\"—yes, maybe they watch it, but no, they don't think it's right. </p> <p>But even accounting for this, the data points to one major conclusion: Most Americans simply don't approve of porn, in any sense. Importantly, this isn't necessarily a call to action, especially because it's unclear what legal regulation of porn would look like, exactly: A government-imposed filter on certain websites? A system of Internet users opting in or opting out of the ability to see hardcore pornography, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/03/david-cameron-internet-porn-filter-censorship-creep\">like Britain has created</a>? Greater regulation of porn production in general?</p> <p>But the sentiment still matters. Most people favor legal restrictions on porn, and an even greater number are morally uncomfortable with watching it. As emotionally charged discussions about erotica continue, it's worth remembering that most people fall somewhere between pro-porn feminists and the misogynist frat boys <a href=\"http://www.xojane.com/sex/belle-knox-duke-university-freshman-porn-star\">who made death threats</a> against the student sex worker at Duke. Americans may understand the right to make and watch porn, but they still don't think it's a good thing.</p><img width='1' height='1' src='http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/37ddb8ce/sc/38/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fmost-people-think-watching-porn-is-morally-wrong%2F284240%2F&t=Most+People+Think+Watching+Porn+Is+Morally+Wrong\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png\" border=\"0\" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fmost-people-think-watching-porn-is-morally-wrong%2F284240%2F&t=Most+People+Think+Watching+Porn+Is+Morally+Wrong\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png\" border=\"0\" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fmost-people-think-watching-porn-is-morally-wrong%2F284240%2F&t=Most+People+Think+Watching+Porn+Is+Morally+Wrong\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png\" border=\"0\" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fmost-people-think-watching-porn-is-morally-wrong%2F284240%2F&t=Most+People+Think+Watching+Porn+Is+Morally+Wrong\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png\" border=\"0\" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fpolitics%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fmost-people-think-watching-porn-is-morally-wrong%2F284240%2F&t=Most+People+Think+Watching+Porn+Is+Morally+Wrong\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png\" border=\"0\" /></a></td><td valign='middle'></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531461967/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37ddb8ce/sc/38/rc/1/rc.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531461967/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37ddb8ce/sc/38/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531461967/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37ddb8ce/sc/38/rc/2/rc.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531461967/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37ddb8ce/sc/38/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531461967/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37ddb8ce/sc/38/rc/3/rc.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531461967/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37ddb8ce/sc/38/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531461967/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37ddb8ce/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/186531461967/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37ddb8ce/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/186531461967/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37ddb8ce/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/WxuWfPd0cCM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", "permalinkUrl" : "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/WxuWfPd0cCM/story01.htm", "standardLinks" : { "alternate" : [ { "title" : "Most People Think Watching Porn Is Morally Wrong", "rel" : "alternate", "href" : "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/WxuWfPd0cCM/story01.htm", "type" : "text/html" } ], "thumbnail" : [ { "title" : "Most People Think Watching Porn Is Morally Wrong", "rel" : "thumbnail", "href" : "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/newsroom/img/mt/2014/03/RTX14ER4/thumb.jpg?n1zhoz", "type" : "image/jpeg" } ], "canonical" : [ { "title" : "Most People Think Watching Porn Is Morally Wrong", "rel" : "canonical", "href" : "http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/37ddb8ce/sc/38/l/0L0Stheatlantic0N0Cpolitics0Carchive0C20A140C0A30Cmost0Epeople0Ethink0Ewatching0Eporn0Eis0Emorally0Ewrong0C284240A0C/story01.htm", "type" : "text/html" } ] }, "actor" : { "displayName" : "Emma Green", "id" : "Emma Green" }, "categories" : [ "Politics" ], "source" : { "id" : "master-feed-the-atlantic-2014-3-6-15", "title" : "Master Feed : The Atlantic", "updated" : 1394118886, "permalinkUrl" : "http://www.theatlantic.com/", "standardLinks" : { "alternate" : [ { "title" : "Master Feed : The Atlantic", "rel" : "alternate", "href" : "http://www.theatlantic.com/", "type" : "text/html" } ], "self" : [ { "title" : "Master Feed : The Atlantic", "rel" : "self", "href" : "http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheAtlantic", "type" : "application/rss+xml" } ], "hub" : [ { "title" : "", "rel" : "hub", "href" : "http://pubsubhubbub.appspot.com/", "type" : "text/html" } ] } }, "_id" : { "$oid" : "531896f56662b5901c822b59" } }

These forces convened to produce three interrelated suburban forms: the corporate campus, the corporate estate, and the office park. These landscape types, with their distinct layout of buildings, parking, driveways, and surround, materialized to serve a particular stratum of the corporate hierarchy...</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">\"Pastoral capitalism restructured the metropolitan landscape of American cities and accounts for well over half the office space in the U.S. Corporate campuses, estates, and office parks became American norms and as companies moved overseas, they replicated these homegrown patterns. Eventually international corporations imitated their American counterparts and occupied places such as Silicon Fens in the United Kingdom, Telecom Valley in Southern France, and the Singapore Science Park. Now, Indian software companies attempt to keep the brainy in Bangalore by building corporate campuses.</span></p> <p>\"Because landscapes of pastoral capitalism are engrained in the fabric of low-density, auto-dependent suburbs, they present an obvious target of re-design as we confront the challenge of a post-peak oil metropolis. Rethinking sprawl might begin most effectively with the forms and uses of corporate campuses, estates, and office parks, especially their vast parking lots, roadways, and bucolic greenspaces. In so doing, they can be transformed into places that are both dense and connected, an essential step in building sustainable metropolitan regions.\"</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>3. <a href=\"http://blogs.technet.com/b/inside_microsoft_research/archive/2014/03/05/zootracer-setting-a-track-record.aspx\">A free program to turn animal videos into <em>behavioral data</em></a>.</strong></p> <p>\"The ZooTracer software can provide accurate tracking of multiple, unmarked, interacting animals in arbitrary video footage.

If you find a photo, via Google Image Search or some such, that you want to publish on your blog (or tweet out to your followers, or use as your Instagram profile pic), there is an extremely simple way to accomplish this: Download or screencap the image. Upload it. Boom. The Internet has shared its riches with you once again. </p> <p class=\"p1\">If you have engaged in this process with an image that happens to be from <a href=\"http://www.gettyimages.com/\">Getty</a>, the massive digital photo agency, however ... then you are, I am sorry to tell you, a thief. You have violated Getty's terms of service; you have stolen its stuff; you have (screen)grabbed something that was not yours to grab in the first place.</p> <p class=\"p1\">If you are one of those thieves, then good news! Your days of wanton lawlessness may be over. Late yesterday, Getty <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/5/5475202/getty-images-made-its-pictures-free-to-use\">announced a new system for photo-sharing on its platform</a>: embeddability. Some 35 million(!) of its photos are now free for pretty much anyone to use—for, at least, noncommercial purposes. Which is big news, not only for the web publishers who are growing their ranks pretty much daily, but also for what the move says—and concedes—about the digital economy as it exists in early 2014. </p> <p class=\"p3\">Below, seven reasons why Getty's embed capability is a big deal—explained through seven Getty embeds. </p> <p class=\"p3\" style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong>1. It's finding a way to capture value from thieves.</strong></p> <iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"665\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//embed.gettyimages.com/embed/474625085?et=0zFtckJG_keODYOEX7Oumg&sig=FYFJBGqeQDS_ZU6eY9rn7T8OQDLO_1ustjkvE2GVi40=\" width=\"570\"></iframe> <p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">It's important to note that, while many millions of Getty images are now available for embed, not <em>all</em> Getty images are. And there seems to be a fairly significant split, from what I can tell, between stock images and photojournalism images when it comes to embeddability. So do a search for \"Ukraine,\" and you''ll get lots of photos ... but that one of John Kerry shaking hands with </span><span>Sergei Lavrov in Rome yesterday? Nope, not embeddable</span><span class=\"s1\">. </span></p> <p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s1\">So, basically, if you're in need of a generally illustrative photo to decorate a story about craft beer or bacon or Getty's move to embeddable photos, you should have lots of (now-free!) options. If you're </span><span>looking for photojournalism that will complement your story on Ukraine, however, you might be out of luck.</span></p> <p class=\"p5\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">That distinction </span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">is important; it emphasizes, among other things, the bet that Getty is making by opening this new revenue stream. N</span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">ews outlets, after all, will always need news photos. Keeping the newsy stuff out of the \"free photo\" pool</span><span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"> allows Getty to preserve its value for its already-paying digital subscribers, while the embed system could be a way to capture some value from The Rogues. This is Getty attempting to have its cake, and eat it, too.</span></p> <p class=\"p5\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;\">And while t</span>he embeds are not, at this point, entirely user-friendly—they don't have auto-resizing, for example (the ones below, which originally came in several different widths, I had to resize manually)—they are at least a legal and straightforward way to share images. They're the iTunes of stock photography, basically. </p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong>2. It's taking a big stand on the definition of \"noncommercial.\" </strong></p> <iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"504\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//embed.gettyimages.com/embed/475624257?et=UGfsc6BYpESJDkewGOYc5A&sig=0rdEuf9eOeNhEqZmtJD2DNx3wlO-HGgp07s79mduolk=\" width=\"570\"></iframe> <p class=\"p5\">Here's one of the weird features of the Internet of 2014: Despite the frequency of the term \"noncommercial\" in terms of service agreements, we haven't settled on a common legal definition of it. <span style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;\">Even Creative Commons, </span><a href=\"http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/03/getty-images-blows-the-webs-mind-by-setting-35-million-photos-free-with-conditions-of-course/\" style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;\">the Nieman Journalism Lab's Josh Benton points out</a><span style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;\">, hasn't been willing to take a clear stand on the issue. </span></p> <p class=\"p5\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;\">In 2011, Benton notes, </span><em style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;\">Wired</em><span style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;\"> </span><a href=\"http://www.niemanlab.org/2011/11/wired-releases-images-via-creative-commons-but-reopens-a-debate-on-what-noncommercial-means/\" style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;\">released a set of its photos</a><span style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;\"> under a Creative Commons license. When it did so, it allowed for the photos' \"editorial use by bloggers or any other publisher,\" including those that had ads on them.</span></p> <p class=\"p5\"><span>Getty, in its new </span><a href=\"http://www.gettyimages.com/Corporate/Terms.aspx\">terms of service</a><span>, is taking a similar stand: </span></p> <blockquote> <p class=\"p7\">You may only use embedded Getty Images Content for editorial purposes (meaning relating to events that are newsworthy or of public interest). Embedded Getty Images Content may not be used: (a) for any commercial purpose (for example, in advertising, promotions or merchandising) or to suggest endorsement or sponsorship; (b) in violation of any stated restriction; (c) in a defamatory, pornographic or otherwise unlawful manner; or (d) outside of the context of the Embedded Viewer.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"p1\">But there's still murkiness, even in this. \"Editorial purposes,\" as anyone who has wrestled with the whole \"Wait? What's Fair Use here?\" questions will tell you, is a notoriously vague standard; \"commercial purpose,\" given that many web publications with an \"editorial\" focus serve ads on their sites, is, too. </p> <p class=\"p1\">Getty explained a little bit more about its thinking there to the <span><em>British Journal of Photography</em></span>: </p> <blockquote> <p class=\"p7\">Blogs that draw revenues from Google Ads will still be able to use the Getty Images embed player at no cost. “We would not consider this commercial use,” says Peters. “The fact today that a website is generating revenue would not limit the use of the embed. What would limit that use is if they used our imagery to promote a service, a product or their business. They would need to get a license.” A spokeswoman for Getty Images confirms to BJP that editorial websites, from The New York Times to Buzzfeed, will also be able to use the embed feature as long as images are used in an editorial context.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"p7\">Again: <em>The fact today that a website is generating revenue would not limit the use of the embed. </em>It's notable that Peters emphasizes \"today\" here; these definitions could change.</p> <p class=\"p7\">Still, though: It's a broad definition of \"non-commercial.\" Whether it's a productive one remains to be seen. </p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong>3. It's giving one company—Getty—a lot of control over the aesthetics of the web. </strong></p> <iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"456\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//embed.gettyimages.com/embed/105653920?et=lCCahkBXbUeyOo4I3H7f1w&sig=bH_kQ3qV_A8VzaoR9fcj3ARvn9hbWiXK30BedHmrNoA=\" width=\"570\"></iframe> <p class=\"p2\">The Getty embed, like pretty much other major embed infrastructure, is fairly ugly. It's got share buttons and credits and—lest we forget—the \"getty images®\" logo in relatively enormous font. This is the rough digital equivalent of purchasing a gorgeous Ansel Adams landscape ... and then displaying it in a neon-green, plastic frame.</p> <p class=\"p2\">This isn't, on its own, a big deal; the web is already studded with that kind of visual chrome by way of YouTube embeds, Instagram embeds, embedded tweets, and the like. We're getting used to ugly frames—and not everything, of course, can be Snowfall. </p> <p class=\"p2\">What it means, though, is that images are hosted by Getty, rather than by web publishers themselves. And while \"e<span>mbeds from Twitter and YouTube are already </span><a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/jwherrman/behold-the-great-embeddening\" target=\"new\">a crucial part of the modern web</a><span>,\" The Verge notes, they have also \"enabled a more advanced kind of </span><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot\" target=\"new\">link rot</a><span>, as deleted tweets and videos leave holes in old blog posts.\" </span>And what if Getty, you know, changes its mind about the free-image strategy? What if it deletes some images from the embeddable set? Publishers wouldn't have much recourse. Assuming people actually use the embeds, Getty will have an even bigger say than it already does in what the Internet, as a collective, looks like. </p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong>4. It's (re-)emphasizing the economic value of data. </strong></p> <iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"569\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//embed.gettyimages.com/embed/467771121?et=ymTVqrpE3k29EcSTnyKW4g&sig=OdzGbOkydWdFHL8LC6t7T0m9Uc24Rgco0OZAP2FA16A=\" width=\"570\"></iframe> <p class=\"p1\">If the embeds take off, as well, the brand benefits for Getty—pardon me, for getty images®—are obvious. It's notable, too, that if you click in the sharing buttons included in the photo embeds, the link takes you back to Getty. Which is a nice little branding two-fer. </p> <p class=\"p1\">But the other thing Getty gets in the deal may prove more directly valuable to the company. Here, take a look at Getty's new terms of service: </p> <blockquote> <p class=\"p7\">Getty Images (or third parties acting on its behalf) may collect data related to use of the Embedded Viewer and embedded Getty Images Content, and reserves the right to place advertisements in the Embedded Viewer or otherwise monetize its use without any compensation to you.</p> </blockquote> <p class=\"p1\">Data! DATA. And <em>without any compensation to you</em>, dear user. </p> <p class=\"p1\">This is Facebook's play—and Tumblr's play, and Twitter's play, and Google's play, and pretty much any random web startup's play—applied to the world of web imagery. (It's also not the first time Getty has experimented in this way: <span>Last fall the company </span><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/25/pinterest-inks-deal-with-getty-images-will-pay-a-fee-for-the-photo-agencys-metadata/\">announced a partnership with Pinterest</a>: It gets<span> payments from the image-focused social network in exchange for images' metadata.) </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">User information is valuable, almost implicitly. And Getty isn't alone in attempting to capture it, of course, even when it comes to photos. When, a couple years ago, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/05/the-tao-of-shutterstock-what-makes-a-stock-photo-a-stock-photo/257280/\">I talked with the folks at Shutterstock</a>, another massive stock-photo agency, they emphasized the extent to which their photographers use search data to create their images. Essentially, the reason you get photos like, say, this one ...</p> <figure><img alt=\"\" height=\"387\" src=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/newsroom/img/posts/2014/03/cat_caviar/4f90d6d1d.jpg\" width=\"570\"/><figcaption class=\"credit\"><a href=\"http://www.shutterstock.com/cat.mhtml?lang=en&search_source=search_form&version=llv1&anyorall=all&safesearch=1&searchterm=cat+with+laptop&search_group=&orient=&search_cat=&searchtermx=&photographer_name=&people_gender=&people_age=&people_ethnicity=&people_number=&commercial_ok=&color=&show_color_wheel=1#id=66470527&src=p-65802835\">Shutterstock/Kruglov_Orda</a></figcaption></figure><p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;\">… is that someone (or someones—though it doesn't have to be many) has searched the Shutterstock site for \"fat cat\" or \"cat with money\" or \"rich cat\" or whatever. And then an enterprising photographer has created a photo to fit that search.</span></p> <p class=\"p2\"><span style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;\">It's a feedback loop, a search-mediated conversation between images' producers and their consumers. With its move toward embeddability—and all the delicious, gooey data that comes with it—Getty is trying to get in on the action. </span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong>5. </strong><strong style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;\">It's opening up a whole new space for Internet ads.</strong></p> <iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"406\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//embed.gettyimages.com/embed/sb10063963o-001?et=nBg-czG3eUairGTroUtY2A&sig=ffTq1XmXGrpSs0oynWo1im4bu5F4xstUqt64NO0d2KA=\" width=\"570\"></iframe> <p class=\"p5\">You know now, in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116629/\"><em>Independence Day</em></a>, the alien mothership sent smaller ships to stud the Earth as part of its overall plan of attack? You can think of the Getty move a little bit like that. The embeds—again, assuming they take off—would establish a Getty-controlled infrastructure all across the web. That infrastructure, in turn, could be used for ... ads. Banner ads. Preroll ads. Ads of many, many varieties. </p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: 23px;\">6. It has a pretty significant (potential) loophole. </strong></p> <iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"532\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//embed.gettyimages.com/embed/110499902?et=giF4aMYNYk-A--waTehWag&sig=iFOFB2gijUSMLNWO6smjxWfjzlLJsGBwOWMJAVu2F9Q=\" width=\"570\"></iframe> <p class=\"p5\"><span>Josh Benton, experimenting with the embeds, <a href=\"http://www.niemanlab.org/2014/03/getty-images-blows-the-webs-mind-by-setting-35-million-photos-free-with-conditions-of-course/\">points out a potential problem for Getty</a>: \"The way the embeds are set up, it’s trivial to resize the iframe to eliminate the Getty Images credit and sharing tools at the bottom.\" So you can basically use the embed infrastructure—and have all the right code at the backend—and yet display images without all the visual features that Getty wants you to display at the same time. </span></p> <p class=\"p5\"><span>Would that violate Getty's terms of service? Unclear. </span></p> <p class=\"p5\"><strong>7. It's adapting to users, rather than trying to fight them. </strong></p> <iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"517\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//embed.gettyimages.com/embed/466188051?et=TDUhbPe9tUC9OAeS5ioQ_w&sig=YXczV9z9WDBzQkaPAyXynp2fsCoVPbuHsP4zvt7dFBI=\" width=\"570\"></iframe> <p class=\"p5\"><span>This may be the biggest innovation embedded, as it were, in the Getty move: The company is being realistic about the way its content is being used online. It's trying to find ways to work with users, rather than against them, to build its own brand and find new revenue streams. <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-03-06/since-it-cant-sue-us-all-getty-images-embraces-embedded-photos\">According to Bloomberg Law</a>, Getty has filed only seven copyright infringement lawsuits in the past five years; it seems resigned to the fact that porous walls, rather than solid ones, might make the most sense given the affordances of the Internet. </span></p> <p class=\"p5\"><span>As Craig Peters, a business development exec at Getty Images, <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/5/5475202/getty-images-made-its-pictures-free-to-use\">told The Verge</a>: \"Look, if you want to get a Getty image today, you can find it without a watermark very simply.

This month, his first illustrated memoir will be published. <a href=\"http://www.algonquinyoungreaders.com/book/leaving-china/\"><em>Leaving China: An Artists Paints His World War II Childhood</em></a> (Algonquin Young Readers) chronicles McMullan’s peripatetic existence before and after escaping with his mother from Japanese-occupied Cheefoo, China. Beautifully illustrated in his signature watercolor style, McMullan has written an unsentimental and compelling story tracing the saga of his missionary grandparents, family business, parents’ relationship, and father’s anti-Japanese intelligence work in the British army—all leading to McMullan becoming an artist.</p> <figure><img alt=\"\" height=\"444\" src=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/newsroom/img/posts/2014/03/Screen_Shot_2014_03_06_at_10.31.17_AM_2/01da79290.png\" width=\"570\"/></figure><p><em>Leaving China</em> is a collection of 55 short scenes, each illustrated with a stunning full-page watercolor impressionistically illuminate McMullan’s recollections. “My earliest memory is of throwing a grape,” McMullan writes in the first scene, in which he's bitten by a German shepherd. The incident may have triggered the “unsettling nervousness I exhibited during my childhood,\" though perhaps, he says, \"I was simply destined to be a worried anxious boy, German shepherd bites or not.”  The rest of the book tells continues that theme of uncertainty in a dangerous, war-torn world, and how he found “strength in art and a way to be in the world that was not his father’s or mother’s idea of a man’s life.”</p> <figure><img alt=\"\" height=\"344\" src=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/newsroom/img/posts/2014/03/Screen_Shot_2014_03_06_at_10.29.33_AM_2/7c7d6ba04.png\" width=\"570\"/></figure><p>Over the decades, McMullan has suppressed some early memories and grappled with others. But in 2010,  he rediscovered a box of his parents' wartime letters, which motivated him to finally write down a narrative that pulled together all his memories of his first years traveling between China, Canada, and India. The letters had remained forgotten and unread because McMullan admits he didn't want to revisit the emotions of those times and his relationships with his parents, but, “being in my 70s, I faced the fact it was now or never to pin down what I could about my childhood,” he explains, adding “I needed a sense that I actually had a childhood.”</p> <p>Deciding how to present these intimate recollections was his challenge. McMullan’s wife, Kate McMullan, with whom he’s collaborated a number of children’s stories, initially tried making a book from a single memory onboard the U.S.S. Calvin Coolidge during a thwarted attack by a Japanese dive-bomber. “My character acted very heroically to find my mother a life vest,\" McMullan recalls. \"I think I was always conscious that I was not a heroic little boy, and perhaps that kept me from writing the story for so long. Now that I've spent time writing and thinking about that history, I realize it was about survival and not heroics, and that my life as an artist was a kind of strength that came out of the experience.”</p> <figure><img alt=\"\" height=\"344\" src=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/newsroom/img/posts/2014/03/Screen_Shot_2014_03_06_at_10.31.09_AM_2/803c76c1b.png\" width=\"570\"/></figure><p>Apart from the letters, McMullan says he referred to his sister’s and father's diaries, reminiscences by an older cousin, a book on British Army intelligence in China and, most importantly, two family photo albums from the early years in China. For the history of his paternal grandparents, he says, he relied on the stories his mother and cousin had told him and what he could further glean about The McMullan Company from dated Cheefoo newspapers. </p> <p>McMullan’s economical writing style complements the eloquence of the watercolor paintings. “I hoped that the illustrations would more effectively express the emotions that the writing only hinted at,” he says. “It wasn't really difficult to decide on what to show in the pictures—they were scenes that have gestated in my mind for a long time. The incidents in the text always had a ‘center’ that the paintings could illuminate. Once I had written the scene, I approached making the image very much as something that had to work as an imagined and ‘synthetic’ work of art, not as a recreation of actual events. My use of a somewhat un-naturalistic color palette and an omniscient, high point of view was part of my method to free myself from what might have been the pressure to make ‘true’ illustrations.”</p> <figure><img alt=\"\" height=\"614\" src=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/newsroom/img/posts/2014/03/Screen_Shot_2014_03_06_at_10.30.10_AM_2-2/3941cebd6.png\" width=\"570\"/></figure><p>Working on the book, he says he became “in a way, two people.” One was the author writing down the memories in an economical style, and the other was the artist “making creative ‘hay’ out of the material.”  </p> <p>“I tried to be truthful and fair,” he adds. “I didn't know my father well enough to make judgments about him, and what I wrote about my mother I hope conveyed that, along with her self- absorption and alcoholism, she was a witty and charming person.”</p> <p>With the exception of a few pictures drawn from the family album, almost every image is based on imagination. “I've actually never done illustrations before that were so much imagined and so little based on reference,” he says, referring to his representational impressionist style. The most menacing scenes of The Japanese army “were imagined scenes.” Also a central inspiration for McMullan’s approach are Chinese scroll paintings where the tableaus are depicted from a high vantage point and the figures and objects are relatively small. “The tone of the pictures is distant,” he adds. “They reflect how much these memories are part of a dream-like past. The closest I get to the sense of immediate crisis or drama is in ‘The Bombing Scare.’”</p> <figure><img alt=\"\" height=\"339\" src=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/newsroom/img/posts/2014/03/Screen_Shot_2014_03_06_at_10.30.13_AM_2/342eabe17.png\" width=\"570\"/></figure><p>I asked McMullan about his visual voice, which differs from his theater posters. He recalls that the first picture he did for this project was the book's cover image, which set up the style for the rest of the pictures. “I had tried drawing the scene with a more realistic, lower-horizon view point but realized I had to find a more imaginative, dream-like frame of reference,\" he says. \"It was a moment when I realized how free I was to make the images whatever I wanted. That probably sounds obvious, but for an artist with more that 50 years of making space in my mind for the client, it was an epiphany.”</p> <figure><img alt=\"\" height=\"339\" src=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/newsroom/img/posts/2014/03/Screen_Shot_2014_03_06_at_10.49.17_AM_2/58db7f3c5.png\" width=\"570\"/></figure><p>He also tried hard to eradicate the feeling of what he calls \"poor little Jimmy\" from the book: “I hope I've outgrown that persona. And I suppose any memoir is a form of hiding and self-aggrandizement, but all in all, I feel the character and the art are truthful.” </p> <p><em>Leaving China</em> is targeted for an audience 12 and up, but is by no means exclusively for children or young adults. It's really a fascinating recollection/confessional that served as long-overdue catharsis for its creator. “When it was finished it was difficult to work on posters and children's books,” McMullan says. “I spent months basically de-compressing.”</p><img width='1' height='1' src='http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/37de30f2/sc/38/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><div class='mf-viral'><table border='0'><tr><td valign='middle'><a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/twitter/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fentertainment%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fan-septuagenarian-artists-childhood-in-55-watercolors%2F284269%2F&t=An+Septuagenarian+Artist%27s+Childhood%2C+in+55+Watercolors\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/twitter.png\" border=\"0\" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/facebook/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fentertainment%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fan-septuagenarian-artists-childhood-in-55-watercolors%2F284269%2F&t=An+Septuagenarian+Artist%27s+Childhood%2C+in+55+Watercolors\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/facebook.png\" border=\"0\" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/linkedin/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fentertainment%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fan-septuagenarian-artists-childhood-in-55-watercolors%2F284269%2F&t=An+Septuagenarian+Artist%27s+Childhood%2C+in+55+Watercolors\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/linkedin.png\" border=\"0\" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/gplus/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fentertainment%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fan-septuagenarian-artists-childhood-in-55-watercolors%2F284269%2F&t=An+Septuagenarian+Artist%27s+Childhood%2C+in+55+Watercolors\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/googleplus.png\" border=\"0\" /></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://share.feedsportal.com/share/email/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Fentertainment%2Farchive%2F2014%2F03%2Fan-septuagenarian-artists-childhood-in-55-watercolors%2F284269%2F&t=An+Septuagenarian+Artist%27s+Childhood%2C+in+55+Watercolors\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/social/email.png\" border=\"0\" /></a></td><td valign='middle'></td></tr></table></div><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187558566675/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37de30f2/sc/38/rc/1/rc.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187558566675/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37de30f2/sc/38/rc/1/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187558566675/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37de30f2/sc/38/rc/2/rc.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187558566675/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37de30f2/sc/38/rc/2/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187558566675/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37de30f2/sc/38/rc/3/rc.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187558566675/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37de30f2/sc/38/rc/3/rc.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><br/><br/><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187558566675/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37de30f2/a2.htm\"><img src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/187558566675/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37de30f2/a2.img\" border=\"0\"/></a><img width=\"1\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://pi.feedsportal.com/r/187558566675/u/49/f/625839/c/34375/s/37de30f2/a2t.img\" border=\"0\"/><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~4/r18TpPRoEj0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>", "permalinkUrl" : "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/r18TpPRoEj0/story01.htm", "standardLinks" : { "alternate" : [ { "title" : "An Septuagenarian Artist's Childhood, in 55 Watercolors", "rel" : "alternate", "href" : "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/TheAtlantic/~3/r18TpPRoEj0/story01.htm", "type" : "text/html" } ], "thumbnail" : [ { "title" : "An Septuagenarian Artist's Childhood, in 55 Watercolors", "rel" : "thumbnail", "href" : "http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/newsroom/img/mt/2014/03/Screen_Shot_2014_03_06_at_10.30.20_AM_2/thumb.png?n20v0r", "type" : "image/jpeg" } ], "canonical" : [ { "title" : "An Septuagenarian Artist's Childhood, in 55 Watercolors", "rel" : "canonical", "href" : "http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/37de30f2/sc/38/l/0L0Stheatlantic0N0Centertainment0Carchive0C20A140C0A30Can0Eseptuagenarian0Eartists0Echildhood0Ein0E550Ewatercolors0C2842690C/story01.htm", "type" : "text/html" } ] }, "actor" : { "displayName" : "Steven Heller", "id" : "Steven Heller" }, "categories" : [ "Entertainment" ], "_id" : { "$oid" : "5318a49c6662b5901c822b6c" } }

It landed, crucially, in the same position it launched—upright—and that makes it look kind of <a href=\"http://sploid.gizmodo.com/this-is-not-a-frame-from-a-science-fiction-movie-1537271129\">like a science fiction film</a>. You can watch the awesome video below:</p> <figure><iframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"321\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/tdrSYP2gSbg\" width=\"570\"></iframe></figure><p>It’s called Morpheus. While it may never fly in space in its current form, Morpheus is designed to be a useful prototype mission for the space agency, something that engineers can learn and borrow ideas and mechanisms from. It runs on liquid oxygen and methane, <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/08/120810124921.htm\">two fuels which could be made on other planets</a>. It’s also designed to land on rocky or unstable terrain—notice how, at the end of this video, it lands on soil that’s downright Martianesque.</p> <p>Morpheus is, in fact, one of 20 projects that NASA is developing as part of its Advanced Exploration Systems program, which pushes at the edge of the agency’s capabilities. The projects <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/aes/index.html\">range</a> from deep space habitats to radiation protection, from imaging near-Earth asteroids to automating the flight of the International Space Station. NASA is, in fact, <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/FY15_Summary_Brief.pdf\">asking for a larger budget</a> for the program in 2015 (even as it seems to be making <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/03/05/nasa_budget_2015_more_cuts_more_politics.html\">many other harmful cuts</a>). </p> <p>NASA isn’t the only organization developing a rocket like this.

To 52 members of the Senate it didn't matter that the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with those arguments. What mattered was that Adegbile had represented a \"cop killer\" and thus didn't deserve to hold a position in the Justice Department.</p> <p>One of the worst parts of this story is how easily it will transcend this vote and this candidate. When the Senate starts judging nominees based on their past representation of certain clients, when attorneys who want to become public servants are held responsible for the conduct of those clients, and when guilt by association is raised to the level of public policy, it will have a chilling effect on the legal profession. Fearful of being \"Debo-ized,\" lawyers will balk when asked to take on particularly unpopular cases.</p> <p>Late Wednesday, Senator Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat, took to the floor of the chamber to make this very point—and to do so in a way that I think is historic. Every lawyer, law student, law professor, and everyone who cares about the rule of law and the right to counsel, ought to watch this video:</p> <object align=\"middle\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6eae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=9,0,0,0\" height=\"410\" id=\"cspan-video-player\" width=\"570\"><param name=\"allowScriptAccess\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://static.c-span.org/assets/swf/CSPANPlayer.1393874500.swf?pid=318128-5\"></param><param name=\"quality\" value=\"high\"></param><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#ffffff\"></param><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\"></param><param name=\"flashvars\" value=\"system=http://www.c-span.org/common/services/flashXml.php?programid=340212&style=full&version=2014-01-23\"></param><embed align=\"middle\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" flashvars=\"system=http://www.c-span.org/common/services/flashXml.php?programid=340212&style=full&version=2014-01-23\" height=\"410\" name=\"cspan-video-player\" pluginspage=\"http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer\" quality=\"high\" src=\"http://static.c-span.org/assets/swf/CSPANPlayer.1393874500.swf?pid=318128-5\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"570\"></embed></object> <p>John Roberts, the chief justice of the United States, deserves praise for his long-ago representation of serial killer John Ferguson. It is what lawyers do. Obviously, it's not the chief justice's fault that he was not questioned at length about it during either of his confirmation hearings. Such questioning, as Harkin said, would have been as inappropriate as it was in Adegbile's case. But it <em>will</em> be the chief justice's fault if he remains silent now that the Adegbile vote has been taken and the extent of the problem has been made clear.</p> <p>The chief justice should issue a statement as soon as he can about his role in the Ferguson case. He should explain why every criminal defendant deserves a lawyer—it's a constitutional right, after all—and why lawyers have professional obligations to advocate on behalf of even the most despised members of our society. He should reaffirm the notion that rule of law cannot succeed if attorneys are judged guilty by association with their clients. And he should urge young lawyers not to be afraid to work on unpopular cases.</p> <p>Given the wide range in which the justices roam in their public speeches and writing beyond the Supreme Court, the chief justice could easily issue such a statement within the boundaries of his own professional obligations. In doing so, he could both educate the American people and elevate the debate over what has just happened, and why, and what it means for the legal profession. This is a moment for the type of leadership that only the Supreme Court can offer. And only the chief justice can speak for the Court. </p><img width='1' height='1' src='http://Theatlantic.feedsportal.com/c/34375/f/625839/s/37ded36b/sc/1/mf.gif' border='0'/><br clear='all'/><div

Amazon purchases of garbage bags and Canon 5Ds, <a href=\"http://www.etsy.com/search?q=needle%20felted%20animal&ship_to=US&ref=auto6\">felted animals</a> on Etsy, Ikea rugs, <a href=\"http://www.walmart.com/browse/toys/trampolines/4171_14521_5230/?povid=P1171-C1143.3596+1139.4650-L2\">trampolines</a> from Walmart.com, diapers from Diapers.com, stamps from Stamps.com, etc.</p> <p>That's e-commerce, and it was a roughly $638 billion business last year.</p> <p>M-commerce is different: It's the stuff you buy on mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. And we all know it is growing fast. Walmart's head of digital innovation told me that, last year, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/03/get-ready-to-roboshop/357569/\">more than 50 percent of the visits</a> to their website were coming on mobile devices. </p> <p>Last night, newly minted investor Om Malik <a href=\"https://twitter.com/om/status/441454975190073344/photo/1\">posted Goldman Sachs quantitative forecasts</a> for that growth. </p> <p>Goldman says that by 2018, we'll be seeing roughly as much mobile commerce ($626 billion) as we saw in e-commerce last year. <span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">In the shorter term, we're talking a tripling from 2012 to 2014. </span></p> <p>I will note that one number—or really, one ratio—seems worth thinking more about. </p> <figure><img alt=\"\" height=\"93\" src=\"http://cdn.theatlantic.com/newsroom/img/posts/2014/03/drilldown/2efeb088d.jpg\" width=\"570\"/></figure><p>Goldman's forecast here is that <em>most</em> m-commerce will be tablet-based. While they predict smartphone-based m-commerce growing at $20-$30 billion a year, they see a massive explosion in tablet-based sales. </p> <p>Another way to logic-check this Goldman forecast is that they see a bigger <em>increase</em> in m-commerce on tablets between 2013 and 2014 alone than the entire smartphone m-commerce market in 2013.</p> <p>I'm not saying this is wrong, only that it doesn't track with our general experience of what \"mobile\" has meant. <span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">I'm talking traffic here, but what we've seen is tablets, despite relatively low prices and wide availability, experiencing steady growth—while smartphone traffic, on the other hand, has exploded. </span></p><img width='1' height='1'
